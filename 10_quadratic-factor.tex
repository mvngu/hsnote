  The quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 + bx$ can be visualised as a
  square plus a rectangle.  The square has a side length of $x$, hence
  the area of the square is $x^2$.  The rectangle has a width of $b$
  and a height of $x$, so the rectangle has an area of $bx$.  Thus
  $f(x)$ can be interpreted as the area of a square plus the area of a
  rectangle.  The rectangle can be cut in half along the dashed line
  as shown.  Each half has a width of $b/2$ and a height of $x$.

\caption{%%
  The quadratic function $f(x) = x^2 + bx$ can be visualised as a
  square plus a rectangle.  The rectangle is cut in half.  One half is
  arranged to the right of the square.  The other half is arranged
  underneath the square.  Now you have a shape that is nearly like a
  square.  The small dashed square in the lower right is what is
  missing to make a complete square.
