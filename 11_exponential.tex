\section{An example}

Exponential functions are commonly used to understand the change in a
population over time.  The population can be the residents of a
country, the ants in an ant colony, the bacteria in a Petri dish, or
the amount of carbon-14 in the bone of an animal that lived thousands
of years ago.  In particular, what you want to know is the
\emph{percentage rate} of change over time, where time can be measured
in terms of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years.  If you
know the \emph{initial population} and the percentage rate of change,
then you can use the exponential function to calculate the population
in the next year or the next three years.  The following example
should help you to understand the ideas presented above.

\begin{example}
\label{eg:Australian_population_2017}
\textbf{Population of Australia.}
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics~(ABS), at the end of
September 2017 the population of Australia grew by $1.6\%$ since the
previous year.\footnote{
  ``3101.0 - Australian Demographic Statistics, Sep 2017'',
  \url{http://web.archive.org/web/20180420062713/http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3101.0Main+Features1Sep\%202017},
  accessed 2018-04-20.
}
The population by the end of the given period was estimated to be
$24.7029$ million people.  Assume that for the next few years the
population of Australia will grow by a rate of $1.6\%$ per annum.
%%
\begin{packedenum}
\item\label{subeg:Australian_population_2017_growth_rate}
  Identify the rate of change.

\item\label{subeg:Australian_population_2017_initial_population}
  Determine the initial population.

\item\label{subeg:Australian_population_2017_table_graph}
  Provide a table of values for the projected population of Australia
  from 2017 to 2021, inclusive.  Graph the data in the table as a
  scatter plot.
\end{packedenum}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subeg:Australian_population_2017_growth_rate}
By the end of September 2017, the population of Australia grew by
$1.6\%$ from the previous year so the percentage rate of change is
$1.6\%$.  Since you are concerned with population growth, the rate of
change in this example is also called the \emph{growth rate}.  The
growth rate can be written as a percentage or as a fraction.  To
express the percentage of $1.6\%$ as a fraction, you divide the number
$1.6$ by $100$ to get the decimal representation
\[
\frac{1.6}{100}
=
0.016.
\]
That is, you can also say that the growth rate is $0.016$ per annum.

\solutionpart{subeg:Australian_population_2017_initial_population}
The example does not explicitly state the value of the initial
population.  However, the example does say that the population of
Australia by the end of September 2017 was $24.7029$ million people so
you can consider this number as the initial population.  The reason
why you require an initial population is so that the population can
grow or decline.  You need to start somewhere.

\solutionpart{subeg:Australian_population_2017_table_graph}
You are required to predict the population of Australia from $2018$ to
$2021$, inclusive.  To calculate the projected~(or predicted)
population in $2018$, you must know two numbers: the population in
$2017$ and the growth rate.
From \Part{subeg:Australian_population_2017_growth_rate} you know that
the growth rate is $0.016$ per annum and
from \Part{subeg:Australian_population_2017_initial_population} you
know that the population of Australia for 2017 was $24.7029$ million
people.  By $2018$, the population would have increased by
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Australian_population_2018}
24.7029 \times 0.016
=
0.3952464
\end{equation}
%%
million people.  To calculate the population for $2018$, you must add
the number in~\eqref{eqn:Australian_population_2018} to the population
in $2017$.  The projected population for $2018$ is given by the
expression $24.7029 + 24.7029 \times 0.016$.  Factoring out the number
$24.7029$ and simplifying shows that the required population number is
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Australian_population_2018_calculation}
\begin{aligned}
&24.7029 + 24.7029 \times 0.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 (1 + 0.016) \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016 \\[4pt]
&=
25.0981464
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%%
million people.

Now use the same technique as explained above to calculate the
projected population for $2019$.  You already know that the growth
rate is $0.016$ per annum and that the population in $2018$ would be
$25.0981464$ million people.  By $2019$, the population would have
increased by
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Australian_population_2019}
25.0981464 \times 0.016
=
0.4015703424
\end{equation}
%%
million people.  The projected population for $2019$ is the number
in~\eqref{eqn:Australian_population_2019} added to the population in
$2018$.  By $2019$ Australia is projected to have a population of
%%
\begin{align*}
&25.0981464 + 25.0981464 \times 0.016 \\[4pt]
&=
25.0981464 (1 + 0.016) \\[4pt]
&=
25.0981464 \times 1.016 \\[4pt]
&=
25.4997167424
\end{align*}
%%
million people.  Use the same technique as explained above to
calculate the projected population in $2020$ and $2021$.  The
projected populations through to the year $2021$ are shown in
\Table{tab:Australian_population_2017}, a graph of which is
illustrated in \Figure{fig:Australian_population_2017}.
\end{solution}

  The population numbers are in terms of millions.  For example, the

}
\label{fig:Australian_population_2017}
\end{figure}

The next question you might ask is:  Is there a formula to calculate
the population of Australia for any number of years since $2017$?  The
answer is yes, but you must assume that the population grows by a
constant percentage rate each year.  Assume that you have an initial
population of $24.7029$ million people in $2017$ and that the growth
rate is $1.6\%$ or $0.016$ per annum.  According to
\Equation{eqn:Australian_population_2018_calculation}, in
$2018$~(i.e.~one year from $2017$) the population can be written as
the expression
\[
24.7029 + 24.7029 \times 0.016
=
24.7029 \times 1.016.
\]
In $2019$~(i.e.~two years from $2017$) the population can be written
as
%%
\begin{align*}
&24.7029 \times 1.016 + 24.7029 \times 1.016 \times 0.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016 (1 + 0.016) \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016 \times 1.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^2.
\end{align*}
%%
In $2020$~(i.e.~three years from $2017$) the population can be written
as
%%
\begin{align*}
&24.7029 \times 1.016^2 + 24.7029 \times 1.016^2 \times 0.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^2 (1 + 0.016) \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^2 \times 1.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^3.
\end{align*}
%%
In $2021$~(i.e.~four years from $2017$) the population can be written
as
%%
\begin{align*}
&24.7029 \times 1.016^3 + 24.7029 \times 1.016^3 \times 0.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^3 (1 + 0.016) \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^3 \times 1.016 \\[4pt]
&=
24.7029 \times 1.016^4.
\end{align*}
%%
From the above equations, you can see that the only number that
changes is the exponent or power of $1.016$.  If $t$ is the number of
years since $2017$, then the population~(in millions) in $t$ years
since $2017$ can be written as
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Australian_population_formula}
24.7029 \times 1.016^t.
\end{equation}
%%
You can see from \Expression{eqn:Australian_population_formula} that
the initial population is $24.7029$ million people.  The number
$1.016$ is called the \emph{growth factor} and can be written in terms
of the growth rate as $1.016 = 1 + 0.016$.

\begin{exercise}
Use \Expression{eqn:Australian_population_formula} to verify the
population numbers in \Table{tab:Australian_population_2017}.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
In \Table{tab:Australian_population_2017}, the year $2017$ is $t = 0$
years since $2017$ so according to
\Expression{eqn:Australian_population_formula} the population in
$2017$ is
\[
24.7029 \times 1.016^0
=
24.7029
\]
million people.  The year $2018$ is $t = 1$ year since $2017$ so the
population in $2018$ is
\[
24.7029 \times 1.016^1
=
25.0981464
\]
million people.  The year $2019$ is $t = 2$ years since $2017$ so the
population in $2019$ is
\[
24.7029 \times 1.016^2
=
25.4997167424
\]
million people.  The year $2020$ is $t = 3$ years since $2017$ so the
population in $2020$ is approximately
\[
24.7029 \times 1.016^3
=
25.9077122102784
\]
million people.  Finally, the year $2021$ is $t = 4$ years since
$2017$ so the population in $2021$ is approximately
\[
24.7029 \times 1.016^4
=
26.3222356056429

million people.

\section{Exponential growth}

Let's derive a general formula to model situations such as those
presented in \Example{eg:Australian_population_2017}.  Denote by $a$
the initial value of the population and assume that $a \neq 0$.  Let
$r$ be the decimal representation of the percentage rate of change and
define the growth factor by $b = 1 + r$.  For example, if the
population grows by a constant percentage of $2.3\%$, the decimal
representation of this percentage rate of change is
$r = 2.3 / 100 = 0.023$ and the growth factor is
$b = 1 + 0.023 = 1.023$.  The amount of time since the initial
population is represented by $t$.  So you assume that $t \geq 0$ and
at time $t = 0$ you have the initial population of $a$.  At time
$t = 1$, the population would have changed by an amount of $ar$ since
time $t = 0$.  You add this number to the population at time $t = 0$
to get the population at $t = 1$.  Then the population at time $t = 1$
is given by
\[
a + ar
=
a(1 + r)
=
ab.
\]
At time $t = 2$, the population would have changed by an amount of
$abr$ since time $t = 1$.  You add this number to the population at
time $t = 1$ to get the population at time $t = 2$.  That is, the
population at time $t = 2$ is given by
\[
ab + abr
=
ab(1 + r)
=
abb
=
ab^2.
\]
Now you use the same technique as explained above to obtain the
population at time $t = 3$.  At time $t = 3$, the population would
have changed by an amount of $ab^2r$ since time $t = 2$.  Adding this
number to the population at time $t = 2$ shows that the population at
time $t = 3$ is given by
\[
ab^2 + ab^2r
=
ab^2 (1 + r)
=
ab^2b
=
ab^3.
\]
Use the same technique as explained above to see that the population
at time $t = 4$ is given by the expression
\[
ab^3 + ab^3r
=
ab^3 (1 + r)
=
ab^3b
=
ab^4.
\]
From the above equations, you see that in general the population
$Q(t)$ at time $t \geq 0$ is given by the formula
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:exponential_growth}
\begin{aligned}
Q(t)
&=
a(1 + r)^t \\[4pt]
&=
ab^t.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%%
The above discussion is summarised in
\Theorem{thm:exponential_growth}.
\Figure{fig:general_exponential_growth} shows a general graph of what
an exponential growth looks like.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{image/11/exponential-growth.pdf}
\caption{%%

\label{fig:general_exponential_growth}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:exponential_growth}
\textbf{Exponential growth.}
Let $a \neq 0$ be the initial value of a population.  Assume that the
population increases by a constant decimal rate of $r$ per unit time.
If $b = 1 + r$ is the growth factor and $Q(t)$ represents the
population number at time $t$, then $Q(t) = ab^t$.
\end{theorem}

One of the important ideas in exponential growth is the concept of
\emph{doubling time}.  You can think of the doubling time of a
population as the amount of time required for the initial population
number to double.  For example, suppose a Petri dish has five cells of
a type of bacteria and after $30$ minutes the number of bacteria cells
has doubled to ten cells.  Then the doubling time for the bacteria is
$30$ minutes.  In other words, every $30$ minutes the bacteria
population would have increased by $100\%$.  How can the doubling time
be calculated?

You can calculate a rough estimate of the doubling time of a
population by using a rule of thumb called the \emph{rule of 72}.  If
$p$ is the constant percentage rate of growth of a population, the
rule of $72$ states that a rough estimate of the doubling time of the
population is given by the ratio $72 / p$.  For instance, suppose that
a type of bacteria has a constant percentage rate of growth of $10\%$ per
hour and the initial population is $20$ bacteria cells.  Then $p = 10$
and the rule of $72$ tells you that the doubling time of the
population is roughly $72 / 10 = 7.2$ hours.  That is, after $7.2$
hours have elapsed you should expect the bacteria population to have
increased from the initial number of $20$ cells to $40$ cells.

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{Rule of 72.}
Let $p$ be the constant percentage rate of growth of a population.
Then the doubling time of the population is approximately $72 / p$
units of time.
\end{theorem}

Another way to determine the doubling time of a population is to use
the formula for the growth of the population.  In fact, you can first
use the rule of $72$ to produce a rough estimate of the doubling
time.  Then substitute the resulting doubling time into the formula to
see whether the rule of $72$ gives you a good estimate of the doubling
time of the population.  Going back to the example of bacterial growth
above, where the initial bacteria population is $a = 20$ cells and the
population is assumed to grow at a constant percentage rate of $10\%$
per hour.  The growth rate is $r = 0.1$ per hour and the growth factor
is $b = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1$.  Let $Q(t)$ represent the number of bacteria
cells after $t$ hours have elapsed.  Then the bacteria population can
be described by the formula $Q(t) = 20 \times 1.1^t$.  The rule of
$72$ yields the doubling time of $72 / 10 = 7.2$ hours.  Substitute
this result into the formula to get
\[
Q(7.2)
=
20 \times 1.1^{7.2}
\approx
39.7244
\]
rounded to four decimal places, not quite $40$ cells yet.  In fact,
after $t = 8$ hours have elapsed the number of bacteria cells would be
\[
Q(8)
=
20 \times 1.1^8
\approx
42.8718
\]
which is a little over $40$ cells.  You can conclude that the doubling
time of the bacteria population is roughly $7.2$ hours and at most $8$
hours.  The time of $8$ hours is an upper bound~(or upper limit) on
the doubling time.

\begin{example}
\label{eg:bacterial_growth}
\textbf{Bacterial growth.}
A Petri dish initially contains ten cells of a type of bacteria.  The
bacteria population is known to have a constant percentage growth rate
of $56\%$ per hour.
%%
\begin{packedenum}
\item\label{subeg:bacteria_growth_rate}
  Determine the growth rate and growth factor of the bacteria
  population.

\item\label{subeg:bacteria_initial_population}
  Determine the initial population of bacteria in the Petri dish.

\item\label{subeg:bacteria_growth_1_2_hours}
  Use the same technique as in
  \Expression{eqn:Australian_population_2018_calculation} to calculate
  the number of bacteria cells in the Petri dish after one hour.  How
  many bacteria cells would there be in the Petri dish after two
  hours?

\item\label{subeg:bacteria_growth_formula}
  Derive a formula for the number of bacteria cells in the Petri dish
  after $t$ hours have elapsed.  Use the formula to verify your
  results from \Part{subeg:bacteria_growth_1_2_hours}.  Produce a
  graph of the growth of the bacteria population after the elapse of
  at most $24$ hours.
\end{packedenum}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subeg:bacteria_growth_rate}
Since the bacteria population grows at a constant percentage rate of
$56\%$ per hour, the growth rate is $r = 56 / 100 = 0.56$ per hour and
hence the growth factor is $b = 1 + 0.56 = 1.56$.

\solutionpart{subeg:bacteria_initial_population}
The initial population of bacteria is $a = 10$ cells.

\solutionpart{subeg:bacteria_growth_1_2_hours}
You have an initial bacteria population of $10$ cells.  At time
$t = 1$ hour, the bacteria population would have increased by
$10 \times 0.56$ cells.  Add this number to the initial population to
see that after one hour the bacteria population would be
%%
\begin{align*}
10 + 10 \times 0.56
&=
10 (1 + 0.56) \\[4pt]
&=
10 \times 1.56 \\[4pt]
&=
15.6
\end{align*}
%%
cells.  After two hours, the bacteria population would have increased
by $15.6 \times 0.56$ cells.  Adding this number to the population at
time $t = 1$ hour and you have
%%
\begin{align*}
15.6 + 15.6 \times 0.56
&=
15.6 (1 + 0.56) \\[4pt]
&=
15.6 \times 1.56 \\[4pt]
&=
24.336
\end{align*}
%%
cells at time $t = 2$ hours.

\solutionpart{subeg:bacteria_growth_formula}
From \Parts{subeg:bacteria_growth_rate}{subeg:bacteria_initial_population},
you know the initial population to be $a = 10$ cells and the growth
factor is $b = 1.56$.  If $Q(t)$ represents the number of bacteria
cells in the Petri dish after $t$ hours, then use
\Theorem{thm:exponential_growth} to write
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bacterial_growth}
Q(t)
=
10 \times 1.56^t.
\end{equation}
%%
Let's use the above formula to verify your results
from \Part{subeg:bacteria_growth_1_2_hours}.  At time $t = 1$ hour,
you have
\[
Q(1)
=
10 \times 1.56^1
=
15.6
\]
and at time $t = 2$ hours, you have
\[
Q(2)
=
10 \times 1.56^2
=
24.336.
\]
These are the same as the numbers you obtained
in \Part{subeg:bacteria_growth_1_2_hours}.
\Figure{fig:bacteria_population_24_hours} shows a plot of the bacteria
population within $24$ hours.

  Use the rule of $72$ to calculate a rough estimate of the doubling

\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subex:bacteria_100_cells}
Using \Equation{eqn:bacterial_growth}, after $t = 5$ hours the
bacteria population would be approximately
\[
Q(5)

10 \times 1.56^5
\approx
92
\]
cells, rounded to the nearest integer.  After $t = 6$ hours, the
bacteria population would be approximately
\[
Q(6)

10 \times 1.56^6

144
\]
cells, rounded to the nearest integer.  Therefore you must wait at
most six hours in order for the bacteria population to be at least
$100$ cells.

\solutionpart{subex:bacteria_doubling_time}
You want to know the amount of time required for the bacteria
population to increase from the initial population of $10$ cells to
$20$ cells.  Since the bacteria population grows at a constant
percentage rate of $56\%$ per hour, the rule of $72$ states that the
doubling time of the population is approximately $72 / 56 = 1.2857$
hours, rounded to four decimal places.  Substituting this value into
\Equation{eqn:bacterial_growth} shows that after approximately
$1.2857$ hours the number of bacteria cells has increased to
\[
Q(1.2857)
=
10 \times 1.56^{1.2857}
\approx
17.7133
\]
cells, rounded to four decimal places.  This is below $20$ cells.  If
you substitute $t = 2$ hours into \Equation{eqn:bacterial_growth}, you
obtain
\[
Q(2)
=
10 \times 1.56^2
\approx
24.336.
\]
In other words, the doubling time of the bacteria population is
approximately $1.2857$ hours and at most $2$ hours.

You assume that the population of $a = 10.135303$ million people in
2018 is the initial population.
From \Part{subex:Sweden_population_growth_rate_factor} you know that
the growth factor is $b = 1.012$.  If $Q(t)$ represents the
population~(in millions) of Sweden in $t$ years since 2018, use
\Theorem{thm:exponential_growth} to write
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Sweden_population_formula}
Q(t)
=
10.135303 \times 1.012^t.
\end{equation}
%%
Using the latter formula, at $t = 1$ year since 2018 the population of
Sweden is projected to be
\[
Q(1)
=
10.135303 \times 1.012^1

of Sweden is
\[
Q(2)

=
10.380009755632
\]
million people.  These numbers are consistent with the results
in \Part{subex:Sweden_population_2019_2020}.
\Figure{fig:population_Sweden} shows a graph of the projected
population of Sweden from 2018 up to and including the year 2030.

\solutionpart{subex:Sweden_population_doubling_time}
You want to determine the amount of time~(in years) required for the
population of Sweden to increase from $10.135303$ million people to
$10.135303 \times 2 = 20.270606$ million people.  Since the population
is assumed to grow at a constant percentage rate of $1.2\%$ per annum,
the rule of $72$ yields a doubling time of approximately
$72 / 1.2 = 60$ years.  Substituting the value of $t = 60$ into
\Equation{eqn:Sweden_population_formula} shows that after $60$ years
since $2018$ the population of Sweden would have increased to
approximately
\[
Q(60)
=
10.135303 \times 1.012^{60}
\approx
20.7332548929601
\]
million people, which is higher than the required number of
$20.270606$ million people.  However, if you substitute $t = 59$ into
\Equation{eqn:Sweden_population_formula} you get
\[
Q(59)
=
10.135303 \times 1.012^{59}
\approx
20.4874060207115
\]
and substituting $t = 58$ into
\Equation{eqn:Sweden_population_formula} again shows that
\[
Q(58)
=
10.135303 \times 1.012^{58}
\approx
20.2444723524818.
\]
Therefore the required doubling time is approximately $60$ years and
at most $59$ years.

The doubling time is $24$ minutes, which means that a population of

The constant rate of growth is $r = 100 / 100 = 1$ and the growth

The time frame of $4.8$ hours is equivalent to $4.8 \times 60 = 288$

\section{Exponential decay}

When a population or the amount of something decreases exponentially,
instead of a constant growth rate you now have a constant
\emph{decay rate} $r$.  Multiply $r$ by $100\%$ to get the constant
percentage rate of decay.  Furthermore, instead of a growth factor you
now have a constant \emph{decay factor} $b$.  The constant decay
factor is defined as one minus the decay rate so $b = 1 - r$.  You can
think of the decay factor as the fraction of something remaining after
unit time.  For instance, if the amount of water in a bucket decreases
by a constant percentage rate of $5.6\%$ per minute, the constant
decay rate is $5.6 / 100 = 0.056$ per minute.  The constant decay
factor would be $1 - 0.056 = 0.944$.  Multiply this number by $100\%$
to get $0.944 \times 100\% = 94.4\%$.  In other words, each minute the
bucket loses $5.6\%$ of the amount of water it holds, but the bucket
still has $94.4\%$ of the amount of water.  If $a$ is the initial
population and $Q(t)$ represents the population at time $t$, then
$Q(t)$ can be written as
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:exponential_decay}
Q(t)
=
ab^t.
\end{equation}
%%
You can derive \Equation{eqn:exponential_decay} by using the same
reasoning that led to \Equation{eqn:exponential_growth}.  Note that
\Equation{eqn:exponential_decay} is almost identical to the equation
for exponential growth in \Theorem{thm:exponential_growth}.  The above
discussion is summarised in \Theorem{thm:exponential_decay}.
\Figure{fig:exponential_decay} shows a graph of what an exponential
decay looks like.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:exponential_decay}
\textbf{Exponential decay.}
Let $a \neq 0$ be the initial value of a population.  Assume that the
population decreases by a constant decimal rate of $r$ per unit time.
If $b = 1 - r$ is the decay factor and $Q(t)$ represents the
population number at time $t$, then $Q(t) = ab^t$.
\end{theorem}

Just as an exponential growth has a doubling time, an exponential
decay has a \emph{half-life}.  The half-life of an exponential decay
is the amount of time required to reach $50\%$ of the initial
quantity.  For instance, refer to the bucket example above.  Suppose a
bucket holds three litres of water.  At the bottom of the bucket is a
hole, out of which water leaks at a constant percentage rate of
$5.6\%$ per minute.  To understand the half-life of this exponential
decay model, you ask the question:  How long must you wait for the
amount of water in the bucket to decrease to $50\%$ of the original
quantity?  That is, how long would it require for the amount of water
in the bucket to decrease to $3 / 2 = 1.5$ litres?  You can use the
formula that models the amount of water in the bucket to estimate the
half-life of the model.  \Example{eg:water_level} clarifies this
point.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  Use the formula from \Part{subex:water_level_formula} to estimate
  the half-life of the exponential decay model.
\end{packedenum}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subex:water_level_formula}
The initial amount of water is $a = 3$ litres.  The constant decay
rate is $r = 5.6 / 100 = 0.056$ per minute, thus the decay factor is
$b = 1 - 0.056 = 0.944$.  If $W(t)$ represents the amount~(in litres)
of water in the bucket after $t$ minutes, use
\Theorem{thm:exponential_decay} to write
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bucket_water_level}
W(t)
=
3 \times 0.944^t.
\end{equation}
%%
See \Figure{fig:bucket_water_level} for a graph of the amount of water
in the bucket up to $70$ minutes.

\solutionpart{subex:water_level_half_life}
The half-life of the exponential model~\eqref{eqn:bucket_water_level}
is the amount of time~(in minutes) required for the quantity of water
in the bucket to decrease to $50\%$ of the original amount.  The
bucket originally has three litres of water.  You want to know how
long you must wait for the quantity of water in the bucket to decrease
to $3 / 2 = 1.5$ litres.  Substituting $t = 12$ into
\Equation{eqn:bucket_water_level} yields
\[
W(12)
=
3 \times 0.944^{12}
\approx
1.5024
\]
litres, rounded to four decimal places.  Furthermore, substitute
$t = 13$ into \Equation{eqn:bucket_water_level} and you get
\[
W(13)
=
3 \times 0.944^{13}
\approx
1.4183
\]
litres, also rounded to four decimal places.  Therefore the half-life
of the model~\eqref{eqn:bucket_water_level} is approximately $12$
minutes.

\label{eg:radiocarbon_dating}
\textbf{Radiocarbon dating.}
The amount of carbon-$14$ found in a fossil~(e.g.~an ancient bone or
wood) can be used to determine the age of the fossil.  Assume that the
amount of carbon-$14$ decreases by a constant percentage rate of
approximately $11.4\%$ every $1000$ years.\footnote{
  The most accurate estimation is that the amount of carbon-$14$ in a
  fossil decreases by $50\%$ approximately every $5,730$ years.  See
  the following paper for further details:
  \url{http://doi.org/10.1038/195984a0}.  Where did the $11.4\%$ come
  from?  After $1000$ years, the initial amount of $300$ micrograms of
  carbon-$14$ would have decreased to approximately $265.818669$
  micrograms, rounded to six decimal places.  The fraction of
  carbon-$14$ remaining is the ratio $265.818669 / 300$ and therefore
  the initial amount would have decreased by a fraction of
  \[
  1 - \frac{265.818669}{300}
  =
  0.11393777.
  \]
  Multiply the result by $100\%$ to get $11.393777\%$, which can be
  rounded to $11.4\%$.

\end{example}

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subeg:carbon14_decay_rate}
The constant percentage rate of decay is $11.4\%$ every $1000$ years.
Divide the number $11.4$ by $100$ to get the constant decay rate of
$r = 11.4 / 100 = 0.114$ per $1000$ years.  The decay rate of $0.114$
tells you that you lose $11.4\%$ of the amount of carbon-$14$ every
$1000$ years.

\solutionpart{subeg:carbon14_decay_factor}
The decay factor is $b = 1 - 0.114 = 0.886$, which can be converted to
a percentage as $0.886 \times 100 = 88.6\%$.  In other words, after
every $1000$ years you lose $11.4\%$ of the amount of carbon-$14$ or
that only about $88.6\%$ of the amount of carbon-$14$ remains.  You
might lose $11.4\%$ of the amount, but you still have $88.6\%$ left.

\solutionpart{subeg:carbon14_after_1000_and_2000_years}
After $1000$ years, you would have lost $300 \times 0.114$ micrograms
of carbon-$14$.  Subtract this number from the original amount to get
%%
\begin{align*}
300 - 300 \times 0.114
&=
300 (1 - 0.114) \\[4pt]
&=
300 \times 0.886 \\[4pt]
&=
265.8.
\end{align*}
%%
That is, after $1000$ years you would have $265.8$ micrograms of
carbon-$14$ left.  At the end of $2000$ years, you would have lost
$265.8 \times 0.114$ micrograms of carbon-$14$.  Subtract this amount
from $265.8$ to get
%%
\begin{align*}
265.8 - 265.8 \times 0.114
&=
265.8 (1 - 0.114) \\[4pt]
&=
265.8 \times 0.886 \\[4pt]
&=
235.4988.
\end{align*}
%%
In other words, after $2000$ years you would have only $235.4988$
micrograms of carbon-$14$ left.

\solutionpart{subeg:carbon14_formula_graph}
The unit of time $t$ is $1000$ years.  An increase of $t$ by one unit
translates to an increase by $1000$ years.  You have an initial amount
of $300$ micrograms of carbon-$14$ and a decay factor of $0.886$.  If
$A(t)$ represents the amount of carbon-$14$ remaining at time $t$, use
\Theorem{thm:exponential_decay} to write $A(t) = 300 \times 0.886^t$.
Note that $t$ is in terms of $1000$ years.  So $t = 1$ means
$1 \times 1000 = 1000$ years, $t = 2$ means $2 \times 1000 = 2000$
years, $t = 3$ means $3 \times 1000 = 3000$ years, and so on.

To produce a graph of the amount of carbon-$14$ left after $50,000$
years, you must work out the minimum and maximum values for $t$.  The
value of $t = 0$ means the time at which you have the initial amount
of carbon-$14$ so you take $t = 0$ as the minimum value.  Since $t$ is
in terms of $1000$ years, divide $50,000$ by $1000$ to get
$t = 50000 / 1000 = 50$ so that the maximum value of $t$ is
$t = 50$.  \Figure{fig:carbon14_decay} shows a graph of the amount of
carbon-$14$ remaining up to $50,000$ years later.

You know that the initial amount of fermium-$250$ is $a = 100$
micrograms and that the decay factor is $b = 0.5$.  Let each unit of
time $t$ be $30$ minutes.  If $A(t)$ represents the amount of
fermium-$250$ remaining after $t$ units of time, use
\Theorem{thm:exponential_decay} to write $A(t) = 100 \times 0.5^t$.
Let's use the latter formula to verify the results
from \Part{subex:fermium250_30minutes_60minutes}.  The time of
$t = 1$ translates to $30$ minutes so at time $t = 1$ you would have
\[
A(1)
=
100 \times 0.5^1
=
50
\]
micrograms of fermium-$250$.  The time of $t = 2$ translates to
$2 \times 30 = 60$ minutes so at time $t = 2$ you would have
\[
A(2)
=
100 \times 0.5^2
=
25
\]
micrograms of fermium-$250$.  These are the same numbers as those
obtained in \Part{subex:fermium250_30minutes_60minutes}.
\Figure{fig:fermium250_decay} shows a graph of the decrease in the
amount of fermium-$250$ after every $30$ minutes.

\solutionpart{subex:fermium250_less_than_1microgram}
At time $t = 6$, the elapsed time would be $6 \times 30 = 180$ minutes
and the amount of fermium-$250$ remaining is
\[
A(6)
=
100 \times 0.5^6
=
1.5625
\]
micrograms.  At time $t = 7$, the elapsed time would be
$7 \times 30 = 210$ minutes and the amount of fermium-$250$ remaining
is
\[
A(7)
=
100 \times 0.5^7
=
0.78125
\]
micrograms.  Divide $210$ by $60$ minutes to get $3.5$ hours.
Therefore you must wait approximately $3.5$ hours in order for the
amount of fermium-$250$ to be less than one microgram.

\section{Compound interest}

The \emph{interest} on a given amount of money is the additional
amount on top of the given amount.  When you deposit money into a
savings account, interest is usually calculated on your account
balance and then added to your balance.  The more money your savings
account has and the longer you leave the account open, the more
interest you would earn.  In the context of a savings account, you
would like the interest rate to be as high as possible and the time
between interest calculations to be as short as possible.  When you
take out a loan, interest is calculated on the amount you still have
to repay.  In this case, you want the interest rate to be as low as
possible and the time between interest calculations to be as long as
possible.  \Example{eg:savings_6months} below should help you to
understand compound interest.

\begin{example}
\label{eg:savings_6months}
\textbf{Half-yearly compounding.}
At the start of a new year, you open a savings account and deposit
$\$100$ into the account.  The account earns an interest of $3\%$ per
annum, where interest is calculated every six months~(i.e.~the
compounding period is half-yearly).  Assume that once you have
deposited the $\$100$, you leave the account alone to accrue interest
and no longer deposit any more money into the account.
%%

\item\label{subeg:savings_6months_initial_balance}

\item\label{subeg:savings_6months_growth_rate}

\item\label{subeg:savings_6months_balance_first_year}

  \Expression{eqn:Australian_population_2018_calculation} to calculate
  the balance of your account at the end of the first six months.
  Calculate the balance of your account at the end of the first year.

\item\label{subeg:savings_6months_balance_formula}
  Derive a formula for your account balance after $t$ compounding
  periods.  Use the formula to verify your results
  from \Part{subeg:savings_6months_balance_first_year}.  Produce a
  graph of your account balance within the first three years since you
  opened the account.

\item\label{subeg:savings_6months_doubling_time}
  Estimate the doubling time of the balance of your account .
\end{packedenum}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subeg:savings_6months_initial_balance}
Your account has an initial balance of $\$100$.

\solutionpart{subeg:savings_6months_growth_rate}
The annual interest rate is $3\%$.  However, interest is calculated
every six months.  That is, interest is compounded twice a year.
Divide $3$ by the number of compounding periods per year to get
$3 / 2 = 1.5$.  In other words, the half-yearly interest rate is
$1.5\%$.  The half-yearly growth rate is $r = 0.015$, hence the
half-yearly growth factor is $b = 1 + 0.015 = 1.015$.

\solutionpart{subeg:savings_6months_balance_first_year}
At the end of the first six months~(i.e.~$t = 1$, the time of the
first compounding), you would have earned an interest of
$100 \times 0.015$ dollars.  Add this amount to the initial balance to
get
%%
\begin{align*}
100 + 100 \times 0.015
&=
100 (1 + 0.015) \\[4pt]
&=
100 \times 1.015 \\[4pt]
&=
101.5.
\end{align*}
%%
After the first six months, your account balance would be
$\$101.50$.  At the end of the first year~(i.e.~$t = 2$, the time of
the second compounding), you would earn $101.5 \times 0.015$ dollars
in interest.  Add this amount to the balance at time $t = 1$ and you
have
%%
\begin{align*}
101.5 + 101.5 \times 0.015
&=
101.5 (1 + 0.015) \\[4pt]
&=
101.5 \times 1.015 \\[4pt]
&=
103.0225.
\end{align*}
%%
At the end of the first year, your account balance would be
approximately $\$103.02$, rounded to the nearest cent.

\solutionpart{subeg:savings_6months_balance_formula}
Let $t$ be the number of compounding periods, i.e.~the number of times
interest has been calculated.  Since interest is calculated every six
months, multiply $t$ by $6$ to see that when interest has been
compounded $t$ times then $6t$ months would have elapsed.  The initial
balance is $a = 100$ dollars and the constant growth factor is
$b = 1.015$.  If $B(t)$ represents the balance of your account when
interest has been compounded $t$ times, use
\Theorem{thm:exponential_growth} to write
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:compound_interest_a100_b1.015}
B(t)
=
100 \times 1.015^t.
\end{equation}
%%
The time of $t = 1$ corresponds to the end of the first six months.
Substitute $t = 1$ into \Equation{eqn:compound_interest_a100_b1.015}
to see that at the end of the first six months your account balance
would be
\[
B(1)
=
100 \times 1.015^1
=
101.5
\]
dollars.  The time of $t = 2$ corresponds to the end of the first
year.  Substituting $t = 2$ into
\Equation{eqn:compound_interest_a100_b1.015} shows that at the end of
the first year your account balance would be
\[
B(2)
=
100 \times 1.015^2
=
103.0225
\]
dollars.  These balance amounts are consistent with the results
from \Part{subeg:savings_6months_balance_first_year}.
\Figure{fig:compound_interest_a100_b1.015} shows a graph of the
account balance over a period of three years.

\end{figure}

\solutionpart{subeg:savings_6months_doubling_time}
You can use the rule of $72$ to obtain a rough estimate of the time
required for your account balance to double.  With a half-yearly
interest rate of $1.5\%$, the rule of $72$ states that the initial
balance would double roughly after $72 / 1.5 = 48$ compounding
periods.  Substitute $t = 48$ into
\Equation{eqn:compound_interest_a100_b1.015} and you have
\[
B(48)
=
100 \times 1.015^{48}
\approx
204.35
\]
dollars, rounded to the nearest cent.  Substituting $t = 47$ into
\Equation{eqn:compound_interest_a100_b1.015} yields
\[
B(47)
=
100 \times 1.015^{47}
\approx
201.33
\]
dollars.  Repeat the above process for $t = 46$ to get
\[
B(46)
=
100 \times 1.015^{46}
\approx
198.35
\]
dollars.  That is, your account balance will double after at most
$47$ compounding periods.  Since each interest calculation occurs
every six months, $47$ compounding periods are equivalent to
$47 \times 6 = 282$ months or $282 / 12 = 23.5$ years.

From \Example{eg:savings_6months}, the initial balance is $a = 100$

compounded once per year, the constant growth rate is
$r = 3 / 100 = 0.03$ per annum and the growth factor is
$b = 1 + 0.03 = 1.03$.  If $B(t)$ represents the account balance after

Note that in this case each compounding period corresponds to one
year.  \Figure{fig:savings_1year_6months} shows a comparison of the
account balance when interest is calculated once per year as opposed

$24$ years.  Substitute $t = 24$ into

periods translate to $96 \times 3 = 288$ months, which in turn is
equivalent to $288 / 12 = 24$ years.  However, if you substitute
$t = 93$ compounding periods into

approximately $72 / 0.25 = 288$ months.  However, substituting
$t = 278$ into \Equation{eqn:savings_monthly_balance} shows that
\[
B(278)
=
100 \times 1.0025^{278}
\approx
200.20
\]
dollars, rounded to the nearest cent.  Furthermore, substituting
$t = 277$ into \Equation{eqn:savings_monthly_balance} yields
\[
B(277)
=
100 \times 1.0025^{277}
\approx
199.70
\]
dollars, also rounded to the nearest cent.  Therefore the doubling
time of your account balance is at most $278$ months, which is
equivalent to approximately $278 / 12 \approx 23.1667$ years, rounded
to four decimal places.

    How many times must you perform the doubling process above in
    order for the number of grains of sand on a square to be greater
    than $86$ billion?

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subprob:sand_formula}
Let $t \geq 0$ be the number of times that you perform the doubling
process.  You start off with one grain of sand on the first square so
the number of times you have performed the doubling process is zero.
You perform the doubling process once to obtain the number of grains
of sand for the second square.  To obtain the number of grains of sand
for the third square, you must perform the doubling process three
times.  In general, to obtain the number of grains of sand for the
$n$-th square you must perform the doubling process a total of
$t = n + 1$ times.

Let $G(t)$ represent the number of grains of sand on square number
$t + 1$.  For example, you have $G(0) = 1 = 2^0$ grain of sand on
square number $0 + 1 = 1$.  You have $G(1) = 2 = 2^1$ grains of sand
on square number $1 + 1 = 2$.  On square number $2 + 1 = 3$, you have
$G(2) = 4 = 2^2$ grains of sand.  You have $G(3) = 8 = 2^3 = 8$ grains
of sand on square number $3 + 1 = 4$.  Furthermore, you have
$G(4) = 16 = 2^4$ grains of sand on square number $4 + 1 = 5$.  In
general, you have $G(t) = 2^t$ grains of sand on square number
$t + 1$.

You can also derive the equation $G(t) = 2^t$ as follows.  The initial
amount of sand is $a = 1$ grain.  The constant percentage rate of
growth is $100\%$ so the rate of growth is $r = 1$, hence the growth
factor is $b = 1 + 1 = 2$.  Using \Theorem{thm:exponential_growth},
you can write
\[
G(t)
=
ab^t
=
1 \times 2^t
=
2^t.
\]
You have $G(63)$ grains of sand on square number $63 + 1 = 64$.
Therefore the $64$-th square would have
\[
G(63)
=
2^{63}
=
9,223,372,036,854,775,808
\]
grains of sand.

\solutionpart{subprob:sand_neurons_human_brain}
For $t = 36$ you have
\[
G(36)
=
2^{36}
=
68,719,476,736
\]
grains of sand on square $36 + 1 = 37$.  For $t = 37$, you have
\[
G(37)
=
2^{37}
=
137,438,953,472
\]
grains of sand or over $137$ billion grains of sand on square
$37 + 1 = 38$.  Therefore you must perform the doubling process at
least $37$ times in order for a square to contain over $86$ billion
grains of sand.
