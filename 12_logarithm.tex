\section{What is logarithm?}

Exponentiation and logarithm are inverse functions of each other.
This is similar to the way addition and subtraction are inverse
operations of each other, or multiplication and division are inverse
operations of each other.  Consequently, you can use this inverse
property between exponentiation and logarithm to solve equations that
involve exponential functions.  What does all this mean?

You already know that the function $f(x) = 10^x$ is an exponential
function.  Furthermore, the function $f(x)$ represents an exponential
growth.  Suppose you were to solve the equation
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:exponential_growth_100_10_x}
100
=
10^x.
\end{equation}
%%
Take some time to think about what
\Equation{eqn:exponential_growth_100_10_x} is telling you.  The
equation tells you that you want a value of $x$ such that when $10$ is
raised to the power of $x$, you get $100$ as a result.  What would the
value of $x$ be?  Here, the number $10$ is the \emph{base} and the
unknown $x$ is the \emph{exponent}.  To solve
\Equation{eqn:exponential_growth_100_10_x} for $x$, take the logarithm
to base $10$ of both sides and you get
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:log10_100}
\log_{10} 100
=
\log_{10} (10^x).
\end{equation}
%%
The right-hand side of \Equation{eqn:log10_100} simplifies to
$\log_{10} (10^x) = x$ because the logarithm is to base $10$ and the
exponential function $10^x$ has base $10$.  In other words,
\Equation{eqn:log10_100} simplifies to
\[
\log_{10} 100
=
x.
\]
If $x = 2$, then $10^2 = 100$.  You say that $2$ is equivalent to the
logarithm of $100$ to base $10$.  In symbol, this is written as
\[
\log_{10}100
=
2.
\]
Thus the solution of \Equation{eqn:exponential_growth_100_10_x} is
$x = 2$.  The discussion is summarised in the next definition.

\begin{definition}
\textbf{Logarithm.}
Let $b$ and $y$ be positive numbers such that $b \neq 1$.  The
\emph{logarithm} to base $b$ of $y$ is equivalent to the exponent $x$
of $b$ such that $b^x = y$.  In symbols, you have $y = b^x$ if
$\log_b y = x$.
\end{definition}

The logarithm to base $10$ of $y > 0$ is written $\log_{10} y$ and is
called the \emph{common logarithm}.  If the base is $2$, then you
write $\log_2 y$, which is also called the \emph{binary logarithm}.
If the base is the irrational number $e$, you write $\log_e y$ and
call this the \emph{natural logarithm}.  Sometimes the natural
logarithm of $y$ is also written as $\ln y$.  Whenever you read about
or use logarithm, make sure that you know what base is used for the
logarithm.  Graphs of the above three logarithmic functions are
illustrated in \Figure{fig:logarithm:graphs}.  Note that
\Equation{eqn:log10_100} uses the common logarithm because the base is
$10$.  The right-hand side of \Equation{eqn:log10_100} simplifies to
$x$ due to \Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} below.

  natural logarithmic function $f(x) = \log_e x$, and the common
  logarithmic function $f(x) = \log_{10} x$.

\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x}
Let $b > 0$ be any real number such that $b \neq 1$ and let $x$ be a
real variable.  Then $\log_b (b^x) = x$.
\end{theorem}

Why is \Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} important?
\Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} is often used to solve
equations that involve exponential functions.  In fact, you have
already seen how the theorem was used to solve
\Equation{eqn:exponential_growth_100_10_x} for $x$.  Here are some
more examples.

\begin{example}
Solve the equation $2^x = 64$ for $x$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
The equation $2^x = 64$ asks for a value of $x$ such that when $2$ is
raised to the power of $x$, the result will be $64$.  Since the base
is $2$, take the logarithm to base $2$ of both sides of the equation
and you get $\log_2(2^x) = \log_2 64$.  Use
\Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} to simplify the left-hand side
as $\log_2(2^x) = x$, hence you can write $x = \log_2 64$.  You can
use a calculator or computer program to determine that
$x = \log_2 64 = 6$.  As a check, you can see that $2^6 = 64$.
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
\textbf{Population of Australia.}
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics~(ABS), at the end of
September 2017 the population of Australia grew by $1.6\%$ since the
previous year.\footnote{
  ``3101.0 - Australian Demographic Statistics, Sep 2017'',
  \url{http://web.archive.org/web/20180420062713/http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3101.0Main+Features1Sep\%202017},
  accessed 2018-04-20.
}
The population by the end of the given period was estimated to be
$24.7029$ million people.  Assume that for the next few years the
population of Australia will grow by a constant rate of $1.6\%$ per
annum.  When will the population of Australia be $30$ million people?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
You have seen this example before and know that the population~(in
millions) in $t$ years from $2017$ onwards can be written as
\[
P(t)
=
24.7029 \times 1.016^t.
\]
Note that the base is $b = 1.016$.  You want to determine the number
of years $t$ such that $P(t) = 30$ million people.  In other words,
you want to solve the equation
\[
30
=
24.7029 \times 1.016^t
\]
for $t$.  Divide both sides by $24.7029$ to get
$\frac{30}{24.7029} = 1.016^t$.  Now take the logarithm to base
$b = 1.016$ of both sides and you end up with
\[
\log_{1.016} \frac{30}{24.7029}
=
\log_{1.016} (1.016^t).
\]
Use \Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} to simplify the right-hand
side to $\log_{1.016} (1.016^t) = t$ and you can now write
\[
\log_{1.016} \frac{30}{24.7029}
=
t.
\]
The latter expression evaluates to approximately $t \approx 12.2392$,
rounded to four decimal places.  As a check, you can see that in
approximately $t = 12.2392$ years the population of Australia will be
\[
24.7029 \times 1.016^{12.2392}
\approx
30.000011
\]
million people, rounded to six decimal places.  Therefore some time in
the year $2017 + 12 = 2029$ the population of Australia will be
approximately $30$ million people.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
\textbf{Bacterial growth.}
A Petri dish initially contains ten cells of a type of bacteria.  The
bacteria population is known to have a constant percentage growth rate
of $56\%$ per hour.
%%
\begin{packedenum}
\item\label{subex:logarithm:bacterial_growth_at_least_100_cells}
  Use logarithm to calculate the amount of time required for the
  bacteria population to be at least $100$ cells.

\item\label{subex:logarithm:bacterial_growth_doubling_time}
  Use logarithm to calculate the doubling time of the bacteria
  population.
\end{packedenum}
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subex:logarithm:bacterial_growth_at_least_100_cells}
From a previous example, you know that the bacteria population can be
written as $Q(t) = 10 \times 1.56^t$.  Now you want to solve the
equation
\[
100
=
10 \times 1.56^t
\]
for $t$.  Divide both sides of the latter equation by $10$ to get
$\frac{100}{10} = 1.56^t$, which simplifies to $10 = 1.56^t$.  In the
exponential function $1.56^t$, the base is $b = 1.56$.  Take the
logarithm to base $b = 1.56$ of both sides of $10 = 1.56^t$ and you
end up with $\log_{1.56} 10 = \log_{1.56} (1.56^t)$, which by
\Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} can be simplified as
$\log_{1.56} 10 = t$.  Thus $t$ is approximately $t \approx 5.1780$,
rounded to four decimal places.  As a check, note that
$Q(5.1780) = 10 \times 1.56^{5.1780} \approx 99.9998$, rounded to four
decimal places.  However, if $t = 5.1781$ then you have
$Q(5.1781) = 10 \times 1.56^{5.1781} \approx 100.0043$, rounded to
four decimal places.  In other words, you must wait a minimum of
$5.1781$ hours in order for the bacteria population to be at least
$100$ cells.

\solutionpart{subex:logarithm:bacterial_growth_doubling_time}
The initial bacteria population is $a = 10$ cells.  Double this and
you get $2a = 2 \times 10 = 20$ cells.  You want to know the amount of
time required in order for the bacteria population to double from $10$
cells to $20$ cells.  That is, you want to solve the equation
\[
20
=
10 \times 1.56^t
\]
for $t$.  Divide both sides of the latter equation by $10$ to get
$\frac{20}{10} = 1.56^t$, which simplifies to $2 = 1.56^t$.  Taking
the logarithm to base $b = 1.56$ of both sides yields
$\log_{1.56} 2 = \log_{1.56} (1.56^t)$ and use
\Theorem{thm:logarithm:lob_b_b_power_x} to simplify the last equation
to $\log_{1.56} 2 = t$.  Then $t$ is approximately
$t \approx 1.5587$, rounded to four decimal places.  As a check, you
have $Q(1.5587) = 10 \times 1.56^{1.5587} \approx 19.9997$, rounded to
four decimal places.  However, if $t = 1.5588$ then you get
$Q(1.5588) = 10 \times 1.56^{1.5588} \approx 20.0006$, rounded to four
decimal places.  Conclude that the doubling time of the bacteria
population is approximately $1.5588$ hours.
\end{solution}

  }
  In words, Newton's law of cooling says that when a hot object is
  placed within a cooler environment, the hot object will over time
  cool down to the temperature of its surrounding.  Let $T_o$ be the
  initial temperature of an object and let $T_s$ be the temperature of
  the object's surrounding; temperatures are in units of degrees
  Celsius.
