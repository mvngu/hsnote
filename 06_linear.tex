\section{General form}

A \emph{linear function} is an expression of the form
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:linear_function_general}
f(x)
=
ax + b.
\end{equation}
%%
The numbers $a$ and $b$ are fixed real numbers, while $x$ is a
variable that can be any real number.  What does the function $f(x)$
look like?
