\section{The number $\pi$}

The number $\pi = 3.141592\dots$ is another example of an irrational
number.  The number $\pi$ is often used to measure the area and
circumference of a circle; see \Figure{fig:general_circle}.  Since
$\pi$ is irrational, the number cannot be written as a ratio of
integers.  So for practical purposes, you must approximate $\pi$ as
closely as you can.  The Greek mathematician Archimedes used the
fraction $22 / 7$ to approximate $\pi$.  The fraction $22 / 7$ can be
written as $22 / 7 \approx 3.142857$, correct to six decimal digits.
(The symbol ``$\approx$'' means ``approximately''.)  This is not a
good approximation to $\pi$ because the value of $22 / 7$ differs from
$\pi$ from the third decimal digit onwards.  If a number $p \in \RR$
is to be a good approximation of $\pi$, then it should be possible to
make $p$ as close to $\pi$ as you want.

  zero, you must have $r > 0$.  The \emph{radius} of a circle is
  defined as the distance from the centre of the circle to any point
  on the circle.  The \emph{diameter}, denoted $d$, is then defined as
  twice the radius, i.e.~$d = 2r$.  The distance around the circle is
  called its \emph{circumference}.

\end{figure}

In order to approximate $\pi$ as closely as possible, you must know
how $\pi$ is defined.  Let $c$ be the circumference of a circle and
let $d$ be the diameter of the same circle.  Then the value of $\pi$
is defined as the ratio
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:define_pi_as_ratio_of_c_over_d}
\pi
=
\frac{c}{d}.
\end{equation}
%%
But now you have two problems:
%%
\begin{packedenumeral}
\item How is the value of the diameter $d$ determined?

\item How do you calculate the value of the circumference $c$?
\end{packedenumeral}
%%
The short answer is: You approximate the values of $d$ and $c$ and
then substitute those values into
\Equation{eqn:define_pi_as_ratio_of_c_over_d} to obtain an
approximation of $\pi$.  What follows is the long answer.

\section{Approximating $\pi$ with a square}

Let's start by approximating the value of $\pi$ with a square.  The
square is drawn inside a unit circle such that the four corners of the
square touch the circle; see \Figure{fig:circle_inscribed_square}.
Since the unit circle has a radius of $1$, then the unit square has a
diameter of $d = 2$.  What remains is to approximate the circumference
$c$ of the unit circle.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{image/04/circle-square.pdf}
\caption{%%
  A unit circle with an inscribed square.  A \emph{unit circle} is a
  circle whose radius is $1$.  The centre of the circle has
  coordinates $\tuple{0}{0}$.  The points $A$ and $B$ are where the
  square touches the circle.
}
\label{fig:circle_inscribed_square}
\end{figure}

\Figure{fig:circle_inscribed_square} suggests that the circumference
of the unit circle can approximated by the perimeter of the inscribed
square.  If a square has a side length of $\ell$, then the perimeter
of the square is the sum of all the four sides of the square.  In
other words, the square has a perimeter of
$4\ell = \ell + \ell + \ell + \ell$.  For the square in
\Figure{fig:circle_inscribed_square} the value of $\ell$ is the length
of the line segment $AB$, which can be calculated as
%%
\begin{align*}
\ell
&=
\sqrt{(0 - 1)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} \\[4pt]
&=
\sqrt{1 + 1} \\[4pt]
&=
\sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}
%%
So the square has a perimeter of $4\ell = 4\sqrt{2}$, which you can
take to be an approximation of the circumference of the unit circle.
Using \Equation{eqn:define_pi_as_ratio_of_c_over_d} you see that the
value of $\pi$ can be approximated as
%%
\begin{align*}
\pi
&\approx
\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{2} \\[4pt]
&\approx
2\sqrt{2} \\[4pt]
&\approx
2.828427
\end{align*}
%%
correct to six decimal places.  The approximate value of $2\sqrt{2}$
is worst than Archimedes' approximate value of $22/7$.  Is there a way
to get a better approximation to $\pi$?

\begin{exercise}
Determine the area of the unit circle.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
If $r$ is the radius of a circle, then the circle has an area of
$\pi r^2$.  The unit circle has a radius of $r = 1$ so the area of the
unit circle is $\pi \times 1^2 = \pi$.
\end{solution}
}{}

\begin{exercise}
Calculate the area of the square in
\Figure{fig:circle_inscribed_square}.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
If $w$ is the width of a square, then the square has an area of
$w^2$.  As the square in \Figure{fig:circle_inscribed_square} has a
width of $\sqrt{2}$, the area of the square is $(\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.
\end{solution}
