\section{The sine and cosine functions}

By now, you should be familiar with the sine function $\sin x$ and the
cosine function $\cos x$, where $x$ is an angle in radians.  In this
section, you will further investigate properties of the sine and
cosine functions.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  $f(x) = a \sin x + b$ from $x = -2\pi$ to $x = 2\pi$.  The midline

  $f(x)$ is the absolute value $\absoluteValue{a}$.

\label{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}
\end{figure}

Let $a$ and $b$ be fixed real numbers and let $x$ be a real variable
that represents an angle in radians.  The general sine and cosine
functions can be written as
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trigonometric:general_sine_cosine}
f(x)
=
a \sin x + b
%%
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
%%
g(x)
=
a \cos x + b.
\end{equation}
%%
In the case of the sine function $f(x) = a \sin x + b$, the number $b$
is called the \emph{midline} of $f(x)$ and the absolute value
$\absoluteValue{a}$ is called the \emph{amplitude} of $f(x)$.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:general_sine} shows a graph of the general
sine function $f(x)$.  The amplitude $\absoluteValue{a}$ measures how
high and how low the value of the sine function $f(x)$ can be.  As you
can see in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}, given the sine
function $f(x) = a \sin x + b$ the highest value of $f(x)$ is
$b + \absoluteValue{a}$ and the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$b - \absoluteValue{a}$.  The number $b$ is the midline of the sine
function $f(x)$ because the horizontal line $y = b$ is midway between
the highest and lowest values of $f(x)$.  If you draw the horizontal
line $y = b$ on a graph of $f(x)$~(e.g.~the dashed horizontal line in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}) you will see that $f(x) = b$
whenever $a \sin x = 0$.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{image/13/3-sin-1.pdf}
\caption{%%
  A graph of the sine function $f(x) = 3 \sin x + 1$ from $x = 0$ to
  $x = 2\pi$.
}
\label{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
Consider the sine function $f(x) = 3 \sin x + 1$.  Determine the
midline and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest
values of the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to
$x = 2\pi$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
The first thing you should do is work out the midline and amplitude of
the function $f(x)$.  The midline of the function is $y = 1$.  The
amplitude is $3$.  The highest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by adding
the amplitude $3$ to the value of the midline.  Doing so gives you the
value $1 + 3 = 4$.  The lowest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by
subtracting the amplitude $3$ from the value of the midline.  Doing so
results in $1 - 3 = -2$.  Thus the highest value of $f(x)$ is $4$ and
the lowest value of $f(x)$ is $-2$.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1} shows the midline $y = 1$ as a
dashed horizontal line.

Next, determine all values of $x$ within the range
$0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$ such that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the
midline.  This is equivalent to determining all values of $x$ such
that $\sin x = 0$.  The reason is that if $\sin x = 0$, then the
function $f(x) = 3 \sin x + 1$ simplifies to $f(x) = 1$, which is the
midline.  You know that $\sin x = 0$ when
$x = \triple{0}{\pi}{2\pi}$ and so you have
$f(0) = f(\pi) = f(2\pi) = 3 \times 0 + 1 = 1$.  In other words, the
graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline $y = 1$ at the points
$\tuple{0}{1}$, $\tuple{\pi}{1}$, and $\tuple{2\pi}{1}$.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1} shows the points of
intersection as black dots.

Now determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$, where
$0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$.  To determine the highest point of $f(x)$, you
determine the highest value of $\sin x$.  You know that the highest
value of $\sin x$ is $1$, which occurs when $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Then
the highest value of $f(x)$ is $f(\pi/2) = 3 \times 1 + 1 = 4$ so that
the highest point of $f(x)$ is $\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{4}$.  Similarly,
the lowest value of $\sin x$ is $-1$, which occurs when
$x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.  Then the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$f(3\pi/2) = 3(-1) + 1 = -2$ so that the lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{-2}$.  The highest and lowest points of $f(x)$
are shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the above five points and you obtain the
graph in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1}.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the function $f(x) = 4 \sin x + 2$.  Determine the midline
and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest values of
the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The midline of $f(x)$ is the horizontal line $y = 2$.  The amplitude
of $f(x)$ is $4$.  To obtain the highest value of $f(x)$, you add the
amplitude $4$ to the value of the midline and get $2 + 4 = 6$.  To
obtain the lowest value of $f(x)$, you subtract the amplitude $4$ from
the value of the midline and get $2 - 4 = -2$.  That is, the highest
and lowest values of $f(x)$ are $6$ and $-2$, respectively.

To graph $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$, you should first determine
those values of $x$ for which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the
midline.  This is the same as determining all values of $x$ such that
$\sin x = 0$.  You know that $\sin 0 = \sin \pi = \sin 2\pi = 0$ so
that when $x = \triple{0}{\pi}{2\pi}$ you have
$f(0) = f(\pi) = f(2\pi) = 4 \times 0 + 2 = 2$.  Thus the graph of
$f(x)$ intersects the midline at the points $\tuple{0}{2}$,
$\tuple{\pi}{2}$, and $\tuple{2\pi}{2}$.

Next, you determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$ within the
range $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$.  You know that the highest value of
$\sin x$ is $1$, which occurs when $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Substitute
the latter value into $f(x)$ and you obtain
%%
\begin{align*}
f(\pi/2)
&=
4 \sin \frac{\pi}{2} + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
4 \times 1 + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
6.
\end{align*}
%%
The lowest value of $\sin x$ is $-1$, which occurs when
$x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.  Substitute the latter value into the function
$f(x)$ and simplify to obtain
%%
\begin{align*}
f(3\pi / 2)
&=
4 \sin \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
4 (-1) + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
-4 + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
-2.
\end{align*}
%%
In other words, the highest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{6}$ and the lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{-2}$.

\end{figure}

Finally, draw a wave through the above points and you obtain the graph
shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:4_sinx_2}.  The black dots show the
points at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline $y = 2$.
The red dots show the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.

\begin{exercise}
Consider the function $f(x) = -2 \sin x + 6$.  Determine the midline
and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest values of
the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The midline of the function $f(x)$ is $y = 6$ and the amplitude is
$\absoluteValue{-2} = 2$.  \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6}
shows the midline as a dashed horizontal line.  The highest value of
$f(x)$ is obtained by adding the amplitude to the value of the
midline.  Then the required highest value is $6 + 2 = 8$.  Similarly,
the lowest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by subtracting the amplitude
from the value of the midline.  Thus the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$6 - 2 = 4$.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  A graph of the function $f(x) = -2 \sin x + 6$ from $x = 0$ to
  $x = 2\pi$.

\label{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6}
\end{figure}

To draw a graph of the function $f(x)$ within the range
$0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$, you should first determine all points of $f(x)$
at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline.  This is the same
as determining all values of $x$ such that $\sin x = 0$.  You already
know that $\sin x = 0$ whenever $x = \triple{0}{\pi}{2\pi}$.  Then you
have $f(0) = f(\pi) = f(2\pi) = 6$.  In other words, the graph of
$f(x)$ intersects the midline at the points $\tuple{0}{6}$,
$\tuple{\pi}{6}$, and $\tuple{2\pi}{6}$.  The points of intersection
are shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6} as black dots.

Next, determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.  Note that
the highest value of $\sin x$ is $1$, which occurs when
$x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Then $f(\pi/2) = -2 \times 1 + 6 = 4$, which is
the lowest value of $f(x)$.  That is, the lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{4}$.  Furthermore, the lowest value of $\sin x$
is $-1$, which occurs when $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.  Then you have
$f(3\pi/2) = -2 (-1) + 6 = 8$, which is the highest value of $f(x)$.
The highest point of $f(x)$ is $\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{8}$.  The
highest and lowest points are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the five points to obtain the graph shown
in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6}.
