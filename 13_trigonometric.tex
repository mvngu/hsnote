By now, you should be familiar with the sine function $\sin x$ and the
cosine function $\cos x$, where $x$ is an angle in radians.  In this
document, you will further investigate properties of the sine and
cosine functions.  Trigonometric functions are found in many physical
phenomena.  A common example is sound waves, which can be explained in
terms of a slinky.\footnote{

\section{Vertical shift of sine function}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  A graph of the general sine function
  $f(x) = a \sin x + b$ from $x = -2\pi$ to $x = 2\pi$.  The midline
  of $f(x)$ is the dashed horizontal line $y = b$.  The amplitude of
  $f(x)$ is the absolute value $\absoluteValue{a}$.
}
\label{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}
\end{figure}

Let $a$ and $b$ be fixed real numbers and let $x$ be a real variable
that represents an angle in radians.  The value of $a$ is often
assumed to be $a \neq 0$.  The sine function can be written
as
\[
f(x)
=
a \sin x + b
\]
which is graphed in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}.  The
number $b$ is called the \emph{midline} of $f(x)$ and the absolute
value $\absoluteValue{a}$ is called the \emph{amplitude} of $f(x)$.
The amplitude $\absoluteValue{a}$ measures how high and how low the
value of the sine function $f(x)$ can be.\footnote{
  See the video at
  \url{https://youtu.be/2Kos5VrtTtA}.
}
As you can see in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}, given the
sine function $f(x) = a \sin x + b$ the highest value of $f(x)$ is
$b + \absoluteValue{a}$, which is the value of the midline plut the
amplitude.  Furthermore, the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$b - \absoluteValue{a}$, which is the value of the midline minus the
amplitude.  The number $b$ is the midline of the sine function $f(x)$
because the horizontal line $y = b$ is midway between the highest and
lowest values of $f(x)$.  In fact, if $h$ is the highest value of
$f(x)$ and $\ell$ is the lowest value of $f(x)$, then the value of the
midline is the average $\frac{h + \ell}{2}$.  If you draw the
horizontal line $y = b$ on a graph of $f(x)$~(e.g.~the dashed
horizontal line in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:general_sine}) you will
see that $f(x) = b$ whenever $a \sin x = 0$.  The above is summarised
in \Definition{def:trigonometric:sine_amplitude_and_midline}.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:trigonometric:sine_amplitude_and_midline}
\textbf{Amplitude and midline.}
Let $a$ and $b$ be real constants such that $a \neq 0$.  Given the
sine function $f(x) = a \sin x + b$, the number $\absoluteValue{a}$ is
called the \emph{amplitude} of $f(x)$ and the horizontal line $y = b$
is called the \emph{midline} of $f(x)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  graph of the sine function.
}
\label{fig:trigonometric:sine_vertical_shift}
\end{figure}

How does the value of the midline affect the graph of the sine
function?  The value of the midline has the effect of shifting the
graph of the sine function vertically.  If the value of the midline is
positive, i.e.~$b > 0$, then the graph of the sine function will be
shifted upward.  However, if the value of the midline is negative,
i.e.~$b < 0$, then the graph of the sine function will be shifted
downward.  The vertical shift of the sine function is illustrated in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_vertical_shift}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{image/13/3-sin-1.pdf}
\caption{%%
  A graph of the sine function $f(x) = 3 \sin x + 1$ from $x = 0$ to
  $x = 2\pi$.
}
\label{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
Consider the sine function $f(x) = 3 \sin x + 1$.  Determine the
midline and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest
values of the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to
$x = 2\pi$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
The first thing you should do is work out the midline and amplitude of
the function $f(x)$.  The midline of the function is $y = 1$.  The
amplitude is $3$.  The highest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by adding
the amplitude $3$ to the value of the midline.  Doing so gives you the
value $1 + 3 = 4$.  The lowest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by
subtracting the amplitude $3$ from the value of the midline.  Doing so
results in $1 - 3 = -2$.  Thus the highest value of $f(x)$ is $4$ and
the lowest value of $f(x)$ is $-2$.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1} shows the midline $y = 1$ as a
dashed horizontal line.

Next, determine all values of $x$ within the range
$0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$ such that the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the
midline.  This is equivalent to determining all values of $x$ such
that $\sin x = 0$.  The reason is that if $\sin x = 0$, then the
function $f(x) = 3 \sin x + 1$ simplifies to $f(x) = 1$, which is the
midline.  You know that $\sin x = 0$ when
$x = \triple{0}{\pi}{2\pi}$ and so you have
$f(0) = f(\pi) = f(2\pi) = 3 \times 0 + 1 = 1$.  In other words, the
graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline $y = 1$ at the points
$\tuple{0}{1}$, $\tuple{\pi}{1}$, and $\tuple{2\pi}{1}$.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1} shows the points of
intersection as black dots.

Now determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$, where
$0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$.  To determine the highest point of $f(x)$, you
determine the highest value of $\sin x$.  You know that the highest
value of $\sin x$ is $1$, which occurs when $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Then
the highest value of $f(x)$ is $f(\pi/2) = 3 \times 1 + 1 = 4$ so that
the highest point of $f(x)$ is $\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{4}$.  Similarly,
the lowest value of $\sin x$ is $-1$, which occurs when
$x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.  Then the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$f(3\pi/2) = 3(-1) + 1 = -2$ so that the lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{-2}$.  The highest and lowest points of $f(x)$
are shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the above five points and you obtain the
graph in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_3_sin_1}.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the function $f(x) = 4 \sin x + 2$.  Determine the midline
and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest values of
the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The midline of $f(x)$ is the horizontal line $y = 2$.  The amplitude
of $f(x)$ is $4$.  To obtain the highest value of $f(x)$, you add the
amplitude $4$ to the value of the midline and get $2 + 4 = 6$.  To
obtain the lowest value of $f(x)$, you subtract the amplitude $4$ from
the value of the midline and get $2 - 4 = -2$.  That is, the highest
and lowest values of $f(x)$ are $6$ and $-2$, respectively.

To graph $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$, you should first determine
those values of $x$ for which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the
midline.  This is the same as determining all values of $x$ such that
$\sin x = 0$.  You know that $\sin 0 = \sin \pi = \sin 2\pi = 0$ so
that when $x = \triple{0}{\pi}{2\pi}$ you have
$f(0) = f(\pi) = f(2\pi) = 4 \times 0 + 2 = 2$.  Thus the graph of
$f(x)$ intersects the midline at the points $\tuple{0}{2}$,
$\tuple{\pi}{2}$, and $\tuple{2\pi}{2}$.

Next, you determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$ within the
range $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$.  You know that the highest value of
$\sin x$ is $1$, which occurs when $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Substitute
the latter value into $f(x)$ and you obtain
%%
\begin{align*}
f(\pi/2)
&=
4 \sin \frac{\pi}{2} + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
4 \times 1 + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
6.
\end{align*}
%%
The lowest value of $\sin x$ is $-1$, which occurs when
$x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.  Substitute the latter value into the function
$f(x)$ and simplify to obtain
%%
\begin{align*}
f(3\pi / 2)
&=
4 \sin \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
4 (-1) + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
-4 + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
-2.
\end{align*}
%%
In other words, the highest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{6}$ and the lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{-2}$.

\end{figure}

Finally, draw a wave through the above points and you obtain the graph
shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:4_sinx_2}.  The black dots show the
points at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline $y = 2$.
The red dots show the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.

\begin{exercise}
Consider the function $f(x) = -2 \sin x + 6$.  Determine the midline
and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest values of
the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The midline of the function $f(x)$ is $y = 6$ and the amplitude is
$\absoluteValue{-2} = 2$.  \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6}
shows the midline as a dashed horizontal line.  The highest value of
$f(x)$ is obtained by adding the amplitude to the value of the
midline.  Then the required highest value is $6 + 2 = 8$.  Similarly,
the lowest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by subtracting the amplitude
from the value of the midline.  Thus the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$6 - 2 = 4$.

\end{figure}

To draw a graph of the function $f(x)$ within the range
$0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$, you should first determine all points of $f(x)$
at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline.  This is the same
as determining all values of $x$ such that $\sin x = 0$.  You already
know that $\sin x = 0$ whenever $x = \triple{0}{\pi}{2\pi}$.  Then you
have $f(0) = f(\pi) = f(2\pi) = 6$.  In other words, the graph of
$f(x)$ intersects the midline at the points $\tuple{0}{6}$,
$\tuple{\pi}{6}$, and $\tuple{2\pi}{6}$.  The points of intersection
are shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6} as black dots.

Next, determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.  Note that
the highest value of $\sin x$ is $1$, which occurs when
$x = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Then $f(\pi/2) = -2 \times 1 + 6 = 4$, which is
the lowest value of $f(x)$.  That is, the lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{4}$.  Furthermore, the lowest value of $\sin x$
is $-1$, which occurs when $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$.  Then you have
$f(3\pi/2) = -2 (-1) + 6 = 8$, which is the highest value of $f(x)$.
The highest point of $f(x)$ is $\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{8}$.  The
highest and lowest points are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the five points to obtain the graph shown
in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus2_sin_6}.

\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:5_sin_minus2} shows a graph of a sine
function that has a midline of $y = -2$.  The function has
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{3}$ as one of its highest points.  If the
function is of the form $f(x) = a \sin x + b$, determine the values of
$a$ and $b$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
Since the midline is $y = -2$, then $b = -2$.  The highest value of
$f(x)$ is obtained by adding the amplitude to the value of the
midline.  If the amplitude is $a$, then you have the equation
$-2 + a = 3$.  Solving the latter equation for $a$ yields
%%
\begin{align*}
a
&=
3 + 2 \\[4pt]
&=
5.
\end{align*}
%%
In other words, the amplitude is $a = 5$.  Therefore,
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:5_sin_minus2} shows a graph of the function
$f(x) = 5 \sin x - 2$.
\end{solution}
}{}

\begin{exercise}
A sine function $f(x) = a \sin x + b$ has
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{15}{2}}$ and
$\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}}$ as some of its highest and
lowest points, respectively.  Determine the amplitude and midline of
$f(x)$.  Sketch a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
Since $\frac{15}{2}$ is the highest value of $f(x)$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$
is the lowest value of $f(x)$, then the value of the midline is the
average of the highest and lowest values.  Thus the midline of $f(x)$
is
%%
\begin{align*}
y
&=
\frac{1}{2} \parenthesis*{\frac{15}{2} - \frac{1}{2}} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{1}{2} \parenthesis*{\frac{15 - 1}{2}} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{1}{2} \times 7 \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{7}{2}.
\end{align*}
%%
The amplitude of $f(x)$ is the difference between the highest value of
$f(x)$ and the value of the midline.  The amplitude is also the
difference between the value of the midline and the lowest value of
$f(x)$.  That is, the amplitude of $f(x)$ is
%%
\begin{align*}
a
&=
\frac{15}{2} - \frac{7}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{15 - 7}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{8}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
4.
\end{align*}
%%
Thus the function $f(x)$ can be written as
$f(x) = 4 \sin x + \frac{7}{2}$ and is graphed in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:4_sin_7half}.

the amplitude is $a > 1$, the graph of the sine function is stretched

\section{Vertical shift of cosine function}

Let $a$ and $b$ be fixed real numbers such that $a \neq 0$ and let $x$
be a real variable.  The cosine function can be written as
\[
f(x)
=
a \cos x + b
\]
and is graphed in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:a_cos_b} from $x = -2\pi$
to $x = 2\pi$.  The \emph{midline} of $f(x)$ is the horizontal line
$y = b$.  The \emph{amplitude} of $f(x)$ is the absolute value
$\absoluteValue{a}$.  The highest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by
adding the amplitude to the value of the midline.  Similarly, the
lowest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by subtracting the amplitude from
the value of the midline. Thus the highest value of $f(x)$ is
$b + \absoluteValue{a}$ and the lowest value of $f(x)$ is
$b - \absoluteValue{a}$.  The value $b$ of the midline is halfway
between the highest and lowest values of $f(x)$.  If $h$ is the
highest value of $f(x)$ and $\ell$ is the lowest value of $f(x)$, then
the value of the midline is the average $\frac{h + \ell}{2}$.  The
above is summarised in
\Definition{def:trigonometric:cosine_amplitude_and_midline}.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:trigonometric:cosine_amplitude_and_midline}
\textbf{Amplitude and midline.}
Let $a$ and $b$ be real constants such that $a \neq 0$.  Given the
cosine function $f(x) = a \cos x + b$, the number $\absoluteValue{a}$
is called the \emph{amplitude} of $f(x)$ and the horizontal line $y =
b$ is called the \emph{midline} of $f(x)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.1]{image/13/a-cos-b.pdf}
\caption{%%
  A graph of the general cosine function $f(x) = a \cos x + b$ from

  horizontal line $y = b$.  The amplitude of $f(x)$ is the absolute
  value $\absoluteValue{a}$.
}
\label{fig:trigonometric:a_cos_b}
\end{figure}

Just as the value of the midline vertically shifts the graph of a sine
function, the value of the midline also vertically shifts the graph of
a cosine function.  If the value of the midline is positive,
i.e.~$b > 0$, then the graph of the cosine function will be shifted
upward.  On the other hand, if the value of the midline is negative,
i.e.~$b < 0$, the graph of the cosine function will be shifted
downward.  \Figure{fig:trigonometric:cos_vertical_shift} illustrates
the vertical shift of the graph of the cosine function.

\label{fig:trigonometric:2_cos_1}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
Consider the function $f(x) = 2 \cos x + 1$.  Determine the midline
and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest values of
the function.  Sketch a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
The midline of the function $f(x)$ is $y = 1$ and the amplitude is
$2$.  The midline is shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:2_cos_1} as a
dashed horizontal line.  The highest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by
adding the amplitude to the value of the midline.  Thus the highest
value of $f(x)$ is $1 + 2 = 3$.  The lowest value of $f(x)$ is
obtained by subtracting the amplitude from the value of the midline.
Then the lowest value of $f(x)$ is $1 - 2 = -1$.

To sketch a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$, you should
first determine all points of $f(x)$ at which the graph of $f(x)$
intersects the midline $y = 1$.  That is, you want all values of $x$
such that $\cos x = 0$.  The reason is that if $\cos x = 0$ then
$f(x)$ simplifies to $f(x) = 1$, which is $y$-coordinate of the
midline.  You know that $\cos x = 0$ whenever
$x = \pair{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{3\pi}{2}}$.  Then the graph of $f(x)$
intersects the midline at the points $\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{1}$ and
$\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{1}$.  The points of intersection are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:2_cos_1} as black dots.

Next, you should determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.
The highest value of $\cos x$ is $1$, which occurs whenever
$x = \pair{0}{2\pi}$.  Then you have
$f(0) = f(2\pi) = 2 \times 1 + 1 = 3$, which is the highest value of
$f(x)$.  Thus the highest points of $f(x)$ are $\tuple{0}{3}$ and
$\tuple{2\pi}{3}$.  Furthermore, the lowest value of $\cos x$ is $-1$,
which occurs whenever $x = \pi$.  Then you have
$f(\pi) = 2 (-1) + 1 = -1$, which is the lowest value of $f(x)$.  Thus
the lowest point of $f(x)$ is $\tuple{\pi}{-1}$.  The highest and
lowest points of $f(x)$ are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:2_cos_1} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the five points above to obtain the graph
shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:2_cos_1}.

$x = 2\pi$.

\begin{solution}
The function $f(x)$ has a midline of $y = -1$ and an amplitude of
$3/2$.  \Figure{fig:trigonometric:3half_cos_minus1} shows the midline

by adding the amplitude to the value of the midline.  That is, the

\end{figure}

To sketch a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$, first you
should determine all points at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects
the midline.  This is the same as determining all values of $x$ such
that $\cos x = 0$.  You know that $\cos x = 0$ whenever
$x = \pair{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{3\pi}{2}}$ and so you have
$f(\pi/2) = f(3\pi/2) = \frac{3}{2} \times 0 - 1 = -1$.  Thus the
graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline at the points
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{-1}$ and $\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{-1}$.  The
points of intersection are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:3half_cos_minus1} as black dots.

Next, you determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.  The
highest value of $\cos x$ is $1$, which occurs whenever
$x = \pair{0}{2\pi}$.  Then you have
$f(0) = f(2\pi) = \frac{3}{2} \times 1 - 1 = \frac{1}{2}$.  The lowest
value of $\cos x$ is $-1$, which occurs whenever $x = \pi$.  Then you
have $f(\pi) = \frac{3}{2} (-1) - 1 = -\frac{5}{2}$.  In other words,
the highest points of $f(x)$ are $\tuple{0}{\frac{1}{2}}$ and
$\tuple{2\pi}{\frac{1}{2}}$.  The lowest point of $f(x)$ is
$\tuple{\pi}{-\frac{5}{2}}$.  The highest and lowest points are shown
in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:3half_cos_minus1} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the above five points and you obtain the
graph in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:3half_cos_minus1}.

Consider the function $f(x) = -4 \cos x + 3$.  Determine the midline
and amplitude of $f(x)$.  Calculate the highest and lowest values of
the function.  Draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The midline of the function $f(x)$ is $y = 3$, which is shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus4_cos_3} as a dashed horizontal line.
The amplitude of the function is the absolute value
$\absoluteValue{-4} = 4$.  The highest value of $f(x)$ is obtained by
adding the amplitude to the value of the midline.  Thus the highest
value of $f(x)$ is $3 + 4 = 7$.  The lowest value of $f(x)$ is
obtained by subtracting the amplitude from the value of the midline.
That is, the lowest value of $f(x)$ is $3 - 4 = -1$.

\end{figure}

To draw a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$, you should first
determine all points at which the graph of $f(x)$ intersects the
midline.  This occurs for all values of $x$ such that $\cos x = 0$
because if $\cos x = 0$ then the function $f(x)$ simplifies to
$f(x) = 3$, which is the value of the midline.  You know that
$\cos x = 0$ whenever $x = \pair{\frac{\pi}{2}}{\frac{3\pi}{2}}$.
Then you have $f(\pi/2) = f(3\pi/2) = -4 \times 0 + 3 = 3$ and so the
graph of $f(x)$ intersects the midline at the points
$\tuple{\frac{\pi}{2}}{3}$ and $\tuple{\frac{3\pi}{2}}{3}$.  The
points of intersection are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus4_cos_3} as black dots.

Next, you should determine the highest and lowest points of $f(x)$.
Note that the highest value of $\cos x$ is $1$, which occurs whenever
$x = \pair{0}{2\pi}$.  Then you have
$f(0) = f(2\pi) = -4 \times 1 + 3 = -1$, which is the lowest value of
$f(x)$.  Thus the lowest points of $f(x)$ are $\tuple{0}{-1}$ and
$\tuple{2\pi}{-1}$.  Furthermore, the lowest value of $\cos x$ is
$-1$, which occurs whenever $x = \pi$.  Then you have
$f(\pi) = -4 (-1) + 3 = 7$, which is the highest value of $f(x)$.  In
other words, the highest point of $f(x)$ is $\tuple{\pi}{7}$.  The
highest and lowest points of $f(x)$ are shown in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus4_cos_3} as red dots.

Finally, draw a wave through the above five points and you obtain the
graph shown in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:minus4_cos_3}.

\begin{exercise}
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:half_cos_5half} shows a graph of a cosine
function, whose midline is $y = 5/2$.  The function has $\tuple{0}{3}$
as one of its highest points.  If the function is of the form
$f(x) = a \cos x + b$, determine the values of $a$ and $b$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
Since the midline is $y = 5/2$, then you have $b = 5/2$.  To get the
highest value of the function, you add the amplitude to the value of
the midline.  If the amplitude is $a$, then you have the equation
$\frac{5}{2} + a = 3$.  Solving the latter equation for $a$ shows that
%%
\begin{align*}
a
&=
3 - \frac{5}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{6}{2} - \frac{5}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{6 - 5}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{1}{2}.
\end{align*}

In other words, the amplitude is $1/2$.  Thus
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:half_cos_5half} shows a graph of the
function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \cos x + \frac{5}{2}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
A cosine function $f(x) = a \cos x + b$ has $\tuple{0}{\frac{11}{2}}$
and $\tuple{\pi}{\frac{1}{2}}$ as some of its highest and lowest
points, respectively.  Determine the amplitude and midline of $f(x)$.
Sketch a graph of $f(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 2\pi$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The highest and lowest values of $f(x)$ are $\frac{11}{2}$ and
$\frac{1}{2}$, respectively.  The value of the midline of $f(x)$ is
the average of the highest and lowest values of $f(x)$.  Thus the
midline of $f(x)$ is
%%
\begin{align*}
y
&=
\frac{1}{2} \parenthesis*{\frac{11}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{1}{2} \parenthesis*{\frac{11 + 1}{2}} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{1}{2} \times 6 \\[4pt]
&=
3.
\end{align*}
%%
The amplitude of $f(x)$ is the difference between the highest value of
$f(x)$ and the value of the midline.  The amplitude can also be
calculated as the difference between the value of the midline and the
lowest value of $f(x)$.  That is, the amplitude of $f(x)$ is
%%
\begin{align*}
\frac{11}{2} - 3
&=
\frac{11}{2} - \frac{6}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{11 - 6}{2} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{5}{2}.
\end{align*}

Then the function $f(x)$ can be written as
$f(x) = \frac{5}{2} \cos x + 3$, which is graphed in

\section{Period and frequency}

Let $\triple{a}{b}{c}$ be real constants such that $a \neq 0$ and
$c \neq 0$ and let $x$ be a real variable.  Consider the sine and
cosine functions of the form
\[
f(x)
=
a \sin(cx) + b
%%
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
%%
g(x)
=
a \cos(cx) + b.
\]
You already know that the amplitude is the absolute value
$\absoluteValue{a}$ and the midline is $y = b$.  What effect does the
value of $c$ have on the graph of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$?  To understand
how the value of $c$ affects the graph of the sine and cosine
functions, consider the simpler functions $F(x) = \sin(cx)$ and
$G(x) = \cos(cx)$.
\Figure{subfig:trigonometric:sine_horizontal_stretch} shows graphs of
$F(x)$ for $c = \triple{1}{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}}$ and
\Figure{subfig:trigonometric:sine_horizontal_compress} shows some
graphs of $F(x)$ for $c = \triple{1}{\frac{3}{2}}{2}$.  The figures
show that when $0 < c < 1$ the value of $c$ stretches the graph of the
sine function along the horizontal direction.  However, when $c > 1$
the value of $c$ horizontally compresses the graph of the sine
function.  Thus the value of $c > 0$ has the effect of stretching or
compressing along the horizontal axis the graph of the sine function.

Graph the cosine function $G(x) = \cos(cx)$ for
$c = \triple{1}{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}}$.  Also graph $G(x)$ for
$c = \triple{1}{\frac{4}{3}}{2}$.  If $c > 0$, describe the effect of
the value of $c$ on the graph of the cosine function.

show various graphs of the cosine function $G(x) = \cos(cx)$ for
$c = \triple{1}{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{2}}$ and
$c = \triple{1}{\frac{4}{3}}{2}$.  As can be seen from the figures,
when $0 < c < 1$ the value of $c$ effectively stretches along the
horizontal direction the graph of the cosine function.  However, when
$c > 1$ the value of $c$ compresses along the horizontal direction the
graph of the cosine function.  In effect, the value of $c > 0$
stretches or compresses the graph of the cosine function along the
horizontal axis.

\label{fig:trigonometric:sine_cosine_one_cycle}
\end{figure}

The effect of the factor $c$ can also be understood in terms of the
amount of time required for the graph of a sine or cosine function to
complete one cycle.  Let $a \neq 0$ and $b$ be fixed real numbers and
suppose that $x$ is a real variable.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_cosine_one_cycle} shows graphs of the
functions $f(x) = a \sin x + b$ and $g(x) = a \cos x + b$.  If you
interpret the variable $x$ as representing time, then
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_cosine_one_cycle} shows that the graph
of each of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ requires $2\pi$ units of
time to complete one cycle.  Now suppose that $c > 0$ is a fixed real
number and consider the functions $F(x) = a \sin(cx) + b$ and
$G(x) = a \cos(cx) + b$.  The effect of the factor $c$ is to change
the amount of time required for the graph of a sine or cosine function
to complete one cycle.  In many applications of trigonometric
functions, the amount of time required for the graph of a sine or
cosine function to complete one cycle is also called the
\emph{wavelength}.\footnote{

  $c = \triple{\frac{1}{2}}{1}{2}$.

\label{fig:trigonometric:sine_cycle}
\end{figure}

For example, \Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_cycle} shows various
graphs of $F(x)$ for $c = \triple{\frac{1}{2}}{1}{2}$.  When $c = 1$
you have $F_1(x) = f(x) = a \sin x + b$, the graph of which requires
$2\pi$ units of time to complete one cycle.  When $c = 2$ you have
$F_2(x) = a \sin(2x) + b$, whose graph requires $\pi$ units of time to
complete one cycle.  Finally, when $c = \frac{1}{2}$ you have
$F_3(x) = a \sin(\frac{x}{2}) + b$, whose graph requires $4\pi$ units
of time to complete one cycle.  As can be seen from
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:sine_cycle}, when $0 < c < 1$ the graph of
$F(x)$ requires more time than the graph of $f(x)$ to complete one
cycle, which is due to the fact that $c$ horizontally stretches the
graph of the sine function.  However, when $c > 1$ the graph of $F(x)$
requires less time than the graph of $f(x)$ to complete one cycle, the
reason being that $c$ horizontally compresses the graph of the sine
function.  In other words, the value of $c > 0$ not only stretches or
compresses the graph of a sine function along the horizontal axis, the
number also shortens or lengthens the amount of time required for the
graph of a sine function to complete one cycle.
\Definition{def:trigonometric:sine_cosine_period} captures the idea of
the amount of time required for the graph of a sine or cosine function
to complete one cycle.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:trigonometric:sine_cosine_period}
\textbf{Period.}
Let $\triple{a}{b}{c}$ be real constants such that $a \neq 0$ and
$c \neq 0$.  Let $x$ be a real variable and consider the functions
\[
f(x)

a \sin(cx) + b
%%
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
%%
g(x)

\]
The amount of time required for the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to
complete one cycle is called the \emph{period} of the functions.  The
period of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is defined as $2\pi / \absoluteValue{c}$.

\ifbool{showSolution}{

$c = \frac{4}{3}$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
See \Figure{fig:trigonometric:cosine_cycle}.  When $c = 1$, the graph
of $f(x)$ requires $2\pi$ units of time to complete one cycle.  When
$c = \frac{4}{3}$, the period of $f(x)$ is
%%
\begin{align*}

In other words, when $c = \frac{4}{3}$ the graph of $f(x)$ requires
$\frac{3\pi}{2}$ units of time to complete one cycle.

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The period of $f(x)$ is $2\pi / \absoluteValue{c}$, which simplifies
to $2\pi / c$ because $c$ is assumed to be positive.  The period of
$g(x)$ is $2\pi / \absoluteValue{-c}$.  Since $c$ is positive, then
$-c$ is negative and you have $\absoluteValue{-c} = c$.  Thus the
period of $g(x)$ is $2\pi / \absoluteValue{-c} = 2\pi / c$, which is
the same as the period of $f(x)$.

\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
The period of $f(x)$ can be written as the equation
$\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{c}} = \frac{\pi}{2}$.  Multiply both sides
by $\absoluteValue{c}$ to get
$2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2} \absoluteValue{c}$, which upon solving for
$\absoluteValue{c}$ results in
%%
\begin{align*}
\absoluteValue{c}
&=
\frac{2}{\pi} \times 2\pi \\[4pt]
&=
4.
\end{align*}
%%
This means that when $c = 4$ the function $f(x)$ has a period of
$\frac{\pi}{2}$ because
\[
\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{4}}
=
\frac{2\pi}{4}
=
\frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
Furthermore, when $c = -4$ the function $f(x)$ also has a period of
$\frac{\pi}{2}$.  The reason is that
\[
\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{-4}}
=
\frac{2\pi}{4}

\frac{\pi}{2}.

Therefore when $c = \pm 4$ the function $f(x)$ has a period of

\Figure{fig:trigonometric:half_sine_3pi} shows a graph of a sine

possibly shows a function of the form $f(x) = a \sin(cx)$.  The
highest and lowest values of the function are $\frac{1}{2}$ and
$-\frac{1}{2}$, respectively, so that the amplitude is
$a = \frac{1}{2}$.  The graph of the function requires $3\pi$ units of
time to complete one cycle, thus the function has a period of $3\pi$.
The value of $c$ is related to the period by the equation
$2\pi / \absoluteValue{c} = 3\pi$.  Solve the latter equation for
$\absoluteValue{c}$ to get
\[
\absoluteValue{c}
=
\frac{2\pi}{3\pi}

\frac{2}{3}.

You may assume that $c > 0$.  Therefore it is possible that

  Let the twelve months correspond to equally spaced numbers from $0$
  to $2\pi$.  Divide $2\pi$ by $12$ months to get
  $\delta = \frac{2\pi}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6}$.  Starting from $i = 0$,
  let $0 \times \delta = 0$ represent January, let
  $1 \times \delta = \delta$ represent February, let
  $2 \times \delta = 2\delta$ represent March, and so on, up to
  $11 \times \delta = 11\delta$ representing December.  Values of
  $i\delta$, for $i = \seq{0}{1}{11}$, can now be interpreted as time.
  Produce a graph of $i\delta$ versus the mean maximum temperature
  corresponding to $i\delta$.  Explain what you notice about your
  graph.

\item\label{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_midline}
  Suppose that the data in
  \Table{tab:trigonometric:mean_maximum_temperature} can be modelled
  as a function of the form $f(x) = a \cos(cx) + b$, where $x$
  represents a time of the year and $f(x)$ represents the mean maximum
  temperature~($\degreec{}$) corresponding to $x$.  Use your graph and
  the data table to estimate the value of the midline $b$.

\item\label{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_RMSE_R2}
  Calculate the root mean square error~(RMSE) and the coefficient of

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_graph}
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature} shows a graph of the
data from \Table{tab:trigonometric:mean_maximum_temperature}.  The
dots in the figure seem to follow the graph of a cosine function.
This suggests that the mean maximum temperature~($\degreec{}$) can be
modelled as a function of the form $f(x) = a \cos(cx) + b$, where the
parameters $\triple{a}{b}{c}$ are to be estimated from the given
data.

\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_midline}
The value of the midline $b$ of a cosine function is the mean of the
lowest and highest values of the function.  From
\Table{tab:trigonometric:mean_maximum_temperature} you see that the
lowest and highest temperature values are $13.5$ and $26$,
respectively.  The mean of these two values is
\[
\frac{13.5 + 26}{2}
=
19.75
\]
so that the value of the midline of $f(x)$ can be estimated as
$b = 19.75$.

\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_amplitude}
The amplitude of a cosine function is the absolute value of the
difference between the highest value of the function and the value of
the midline.
From \Part{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_midline} you know
that the highest temperature value is $26$ and the value of the
midline is estimated to be $b = 19.75$.  Then the amplitude can be
estimated as
\[
a
=
\absoluteValue{26 - 19.75}
=
\absoluteValue{6.25}
=
6.25.
\]

\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_c}
By definition, the period of the cosine function $f(x)$ is
$\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{c}} = 2\pi$.  Multiply both sides by
$\absoluteValue{c}$ to get $2\pi = 2\pi\absoluteValue{c}$.  Solve the
latter equation for $\absoluteValue{c}$ to see that
$\absoluteValue{c} = 1$.  Assuming that $c$ is positive, the value of
$c$ can be estimated as $c = 1$.  Thus the mean maximum temperature
can be modelled as the function
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_prediction}
f(x)
=
6.25 \cos(x) + 19.75
\end{equation}
%%
which is graphed in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature}.

\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:mean_max_temperature_RMSE_R2}
The root mean square error of $f(x)$ is approximately $0.606277$.  The
sum of squared errors is $\text{SSE} \approx 4.410863$ and the total
sum of squares is $\text{TSS} \approx 226.7225$.  The coefficient of
determination is
%%
\begin{align*}
R^2
&=
1 - \frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{TSS}} \\[4pt]
&\approx
0.9805.
\end{align*}
%%
The low value of the RMSE and the high value of $R^2$ suggest that the
function $f(x)$ models the given data pretty well.
\end{solution}

The \emph{frequency} of a sine or cosine function is a concept that is
closely related to the period.  The frequency counts the number of
cycles per unit time.  For example, if the graph of a sine function
$f(x)$ requires one second to complete one cycle, you would say that
the frequency of the function is one cycle per second.  In various
applications of the sine and cosine functions, the number of cycles
per second is usually expressed in terms of \emph{hertz} and written
as Hz.  In the above example, you would say that the function $f(x)$
has a frequency of $1$~Hz.  As another example, suppose that the graph
of a cosine function $g(x)$ completes one cycle in $0.5$ seconds.
Then in one second the graph of $g(x)$ would complete two cycles and
hence you would say that the frequency of $g(x)$ is $2$~Hz.
\Definition{def:trigonometric:sine_cosine_frequency} provides a way to
calculate the frequencies of sine and cosine functions.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:trigonometric:sine_cosine_frequency}
\textbf{Frequency.}
Let $\triple{a}{b}{c}$ be real constants such that $a \neq 0$ and
$c \neq 0$ and let $x$ be a real variable.  Consider the functions
\[
f(x)

a \sin(cx) + b
%%
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
%%
g(x)
=
a \cos(cx) + b
\]
each of which has a period of $p = 2 \pi / \absoluteValue{c}$.  The
\emph{frequency} of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is the number
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trigonometric:frequency_sin_cos}
\frac{1}{p}
=
\frac{\absoluteValue{c}}{2\pi}.

\end{example}

\begin{solution}
\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:cos_1_cycle_0.25_seconds_period}
The period of $f(x)$ is the amount of time required for the graph of
$f(x)$ to complete one cycle.  Since it is assumed that the graph of
$f(x)$ completes one cycle in $0.25 = 1/4$ seconds, then $f(x)$ has a
period of $p = 1/4$ seconds.  The frequency of $f(x)$ is
%%
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{p}
&=
1 \div \frac{1}{4} \\[4pt]
&=
1 \times \frac{4}{1} \\[4pt]
&=
4
\end{align*}
%%
cycles per second or $4$~Hz.

\solutionpart{subeg:trigonometric:cos_1_cycle_0.25_seconds_c_factor}
Let $p$ be the period of $f(x)$ so that the frequency of $f(x)$ is
$1 / p$.  From \Equation{eqn:trigonometric:frequency_sin_cos}, you
know that the frequency of $f(x)$ is related to the value
$\absoluteValue{c}$ as follows:
\[
\frac{1}{p}
=
\frac{\absoluteValue{c}}{2\pi}.
\]
From \Part{subeg:trigonometric:cos_1_cycle_0.25_seconds_period} you
know that $f(x)$ has a frequency of $4$~Hz, which can be used to
simplify the latter equation to $4 = \frac{\absoluteValue{c}}{2\pi}$.
Solve the last equation for $\absoluteValue{c}$ to get
$\absoluteValue{c} = 4 \times 2\pi = 8\pi$.  If $c = 8\pi$ then you
would get $\absoluteValue{c} = \absoluteValue{8\pi} = 8\pi$.
Furthermore, if $c = -8\pi$ then you would have
$\absoluteValue{c} = \absoluteValue{-8\pi} = 8\pi$.  Therefore the
possible values for $c$ are $c = \pm 8\pi$.

\begin{exercise}
A trigonometric function $f(x)$ has an amplitude of $3$, a midline of
$y = 4$, and a period of $\frac{4\pi}{3}$.  Determine two possible
formulae for $f(x)$.  Calculate the frequency of $f(x)$.
\end{exercise}

\ifbool{showSolution}{
\begin{solution}
You are given an amplitude of $\absoluteValue{a} = 3$ and the midline
value $b = 4$.  If $c$ is a real constant, then $f(x)$ is possibly a
sine function that can be written as $f(x) = \pm 3 \sin(cx) + 4$ or a
cosine function of the form $f(x) = \pm 3 \cos(cx) + 4$.  The
remaining problem is to determine a value for $c$.

The period is related to the value of $c$ via the equation
$\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{c}} = \frac{4\pi}{3}$.  Multiply both
sides by $\absoluteValue{c}$ and simplify to get
$2\pi = \frac{4\pi}{3} \absoluteValue{c}$.  To solve for
$\absoluteValue{c}$, first multiply both sides by $3$, then divide
both sides by $4\pi$, and finally simplify to obtain
%%
\begin{align*}
\absoluteValue{c}
&=
\frac{3}{4\pi} \times 2\pi \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{3 \times 2\pi}{4\pi} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{3}{2}.
\end{align*}
%%
The possible values for $c$ are $c = \pm \frac{3}{2}$.  If you assume
that $c > 0$, then you have $c = \frac{3}{2}$ so that $f(x)$ is
possibly the sine function $f(x) = \pm 3 \sin(\frac{3}{2}x) + 4$ or
the cosine function $f(x) = \pm 3 \cos(\frac{3}{2}x) + 4$.

If $p$ is the period of $f(x)$, then the frequency of $f(x)$ is
defined as the number $1 / p$.  Since $f(x)$ has a period of
$p = \frac{4\pi}{3}$, then $f(x)$ has a frequency of
%%
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{p}
&=
\frac{1}{4\pi/3} \\[4pt]
&=
1 \times \frac{3}{4\pi} \\[4pt]

\frac{3}{4\pi}.

\end{figure}

\begin{example}
\textbf{Blinking light.}
A light bulb is switched on and alternates between on and off.  Thus
the light bulb goes on, off, on, off, on, off, etc.  The light bulb is
on for a brief moment, then goes off for one second, and is on again.
The cycle repeats for as long as electricity is connected to the light
bulb.  Use a trigonometric function to model the blinking light bulb.
Produce a graph of your function from zero up to $\pi$ seconds.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Suppose that $1$~(one) means that the light bulb is on and $0$~(zero)
means that the light bulb is off.  The behaviour of the blinking light
bulb can be described as a sequence of $1$ and $0$:
\[
\seqi{\pair{1}{0}}{\pair{1}{0}}{\pair{1}{0}}
\]
The sequence can be modelled as a function of the form
$f(x) = a \cos(cx) + b$.  The highest and lowest values of $f(x)$ are
$1$ and $0$, respectively.  The average of these two extreme values is
the value of the midline.  That is, the value of $b$ is
\[
b
=
\frac{1 + 0}{2}
=
\frac{1}{2}.
\]
The amplitude is the difference between the highest value and the
value of the midline, hence
$a = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$.  The time between two consecutive
on is one second so the period is one second.  Using the definition of
the period, you have
$\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{c}} = 1$.  Solve the latter equation for
$\absoluteValue{c}$ to get $\absoluteValue{c} = 2\pi$.  Assuming that
$c$ is positive, then you have $c = 2\pi$.  Conclude that the blinking
light bulb can be modelled as the function
$f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(2\pi x) + \frac{1}{2}$, which is graphed in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:blinking_light}.

\section{Horizontal shift}

In this section, you will investigate another property of the graphs
of sine and cosine functions.  Up to this point, you have learnt about
how to stretch the graph of a sine or cosine function along the
horizontal and vertical axes.  You have also learnt about how to
vertically shift the graph of a sine or cosine function.  What remains
to be discussed is how to shift the graph of a sine or cosine function
along the horizontal axis.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  Graphs of the trigonometric functions $f(x) = \sin x$ and
  $g(x) = \cos x$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 3\pi$.
}
\label{fig:trigonometric:standard_sine_cosine}
\end{figure}

What does it mean to horizontally shift the graph of a trigonometric
function?  To answer this question, consider
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:standard_sine_cosine} which shows graphs of
the functions $f(x) = \sin x$ and $g(x) = \cos x$.  Note that you can
obtain the graph of the cosine function $g(x)$ by shifting the graph
of the sine function $f(x)$ to the left.  Looking at the graphs in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:standard_sine_cosine}, the required amount
of horizontal shift is approximately $\frac{\pi}{2}$ units to the
left.  Thus it is reasonable to assume that the cosine function $g(x)$
can be written in terms of the sine function as
$h(x) = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})$ and therefore you might conclude that
$\cos x = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})$.

\begin{exercise}
You will verify that the equation $\cos x = \sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2})$
is true, especially for some special values of $x$.

You also know that $\cos 0 = 1$.

\solutionpart{subex:trigonometric:sin_left_shift_pi_half}
If $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, then
$\sin(\frac{\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin \pi = 0$.  Furthermore,
you have $\cos \frac{\pi}{2} = 0$.

$\cos \pi = -1$.

\solutionpart{subex:trigonometric:sin_left_shift_3pi_half}
If $x = \frac{3\pi}{2}$, then
$\sin(\frac{3\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin 2\pi = 0$.  You also have
$\cos \frac{3\pi}{2} = 0$.
\end{solution}
}{}

\Figure{fig:trigonometric:standard_sine_cosine} shows that you can
also obtain the graph of the function $f(x) = \sin x$ in terms of the
function $g(x) = \cos x$.  To do so, you can shift the graph of the
cosine function $g(x)$ along the horizontal axis.  The amount of
horizontal shift is approximately $\frac{\pi}{2}$ units to the right.
In other words, it is reasonable to assume that the sine function
$f(x)$ can be written in terms of the cosine function as
$h(x) = \cos(x - \frac{\pi}{2})$.  Therefore you might conclude that
$\sin x = \cos(x - \frac{\pi}{2})$.
\Definition{def:trigonometric:horizontal_shift} summarised the idea of
the horizontal shift of the graph of a trigonometric function.

  \Example{eg:trigonometric:mean_maximum_temperature}, use the data to
  estimate the values of $\triple{a}{b}{c}$.  You may assume that the

  Notice in \Table{tab:trigonometry:mean_min_temperature} that the
  temperature starts with $14.3$, followed by the highest value of
  $14.6$.  This suggests that the data can be modelled as a cosine

Suppose that the data in \Table{tab:trigonometry:mean_min_temperature}
can be modelled as a function of the form $f(x) = a \cos(cx) + b$.
The value $b$ of the midline is the mean of the minimum and maximum
values in \Table{tab:trigonometry:mean_min_temperature}.  The minimum
and maximum values are $6$ and $14.6$, respectively, hence the value
of the midline is
\[
b
=
\frac{6 + 14.6}{2}
=
10.3.
\]
The amplitude $a$ is the absolute value of the difference between the
maximum value and the value of the midline.  Thus you have
\[
a
=
\absoluteValue{14.6 - 10.3}
=
\absoluteValue{4.3}
=
4.3.
\]
Since the period of $f(x)$ is assumed to be $2\pi$, then the period
can be written as $\frac{2\pi}{\absoluteValue{c}} = 2\pi$.  Multiply
both sides by $\absoluteValue{c}$ to get
$2\pi = 2\pi\absoluteValue{c}$.  Solving the latter equation for
$\absoluteValue{c}$ shows that $\absoluteValue{c} = 1$.  As you have
assumed that $c > 0$, it follows that $c = 1$.  Thus the function
$f(x)$ can be written as
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trigonometric:mean_min_temperature_cos}
f(x)
=
4.3 \cos x + 10.3
\end{equation}
%%
and graphed in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:mean_min_temperature}.  The
function $f(x)$ has a root mean square error of
$\text{RMSE} \approx 0.631172$.  The sum of squared errors is
$\text{SSE} \approx 4.780541$ and the total sum of squares is
$\text{TSS} = 102.57$.  Then the coefficient of determination of
$f(x)$ is

R^2

Suppose that the data in \Table{tab:trigonometry:mean_min_temperature}
can be modelled as a cosine function of the form
$g(x) = a \cos\bigparen{c (x - h)} + b$.  Notice that the graph of
$g(x)$ can be obtained by shifting the graph of $f(x)$ along the
horizontal axis.  The amount of horizontal shift is $h$ units to the
right.  Since the data in
\Table{tab:trigonometry:mean_min_temperature} starts with $14.3$
followed by the maximum of $14.6$, you may assume that the amount by
which to right shift is
%%
\begin{align*}
h
&=
\absoluteValue{14.3 - 14.6} \\[4pt]
&=
\absoluteValue{-0.3} \\[4pt]

Thus $g(x)$ can be written as
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trigonometric:mean_min_temperature_cos_right_shift}
g(x)
=
4.3 \cos(x - 0.3) + 10.3

%%
and graphed in \Figure{fig:trigonometric:mean_min_temperature}.  The
function $g(x)$ has a root mean square error of
$\text{RMSE} \approx 0.485174$.  The sum of squared errors is
$\text{SSE} \approx 2.824728$ and the total sum of squares is
$\text{TSS} = 102.57$.  The coefficient of determination of $g(x)$ is
%%
\begin{align*}
R^2
&=
1 - \frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{TSS}} \\[4pt]
&\approx
0.972460.
\end{align*}
%%
Notice that the RMSE of $g(x)$ is lower than the RMSE of $f(x)$.
Furthermore, $g(x)$ has a higher value of $R^2$ than does $f(x)$.
Based on the values of the RMSE and $R^2$, you may conclude that
$g(x)$ is better than $f(x)$ at modelling the data in

\section*{Problem}

\begin{problem}
\item Read the following paper by David M. Bressoud:
  \emph{Historical Reflections on Teaching Trigonometry}.\footnote{
    The paper is available at
    \url{https://www.jstor.org/stable/20876798}.
  }

\item\emph{Projectile motion.}
  You have learnt that when an object is launched upward and allowed
  to travel freely along the vertical direction, the motion of the
  object is an example of free fall.  Now consider the case of an
  object that moves in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
  Examples include a car that runs off a cliff\footnote{
    See the video at
    \url{https://youtu.be/XKwrMzcnxmg}.
  }
  or a bomb that is dropped from an aeroplane.\footnote{
    See the video at
    \url{https://youtu.be/IhY9LBNVroo}.
  }
  The object will travel horizontally and at the same time it is being
  pulled towards the centre of the Earth by the force of gravity.  The
  path that the object traces out is parabolic and the movement of the
  object is an example of \emph{projectile motion}.  As an example,
  suppose that a cannon is placed at the top of a cliff.  Let $h > 0$
  be the vertical distance~(in metres) from the top of the cliff to
  ground level.  The cannon fires a cannonball along the horizontal
  direction at a velocity of $v_x$ metres per second.
  %%
  \begin{packedenum}
  \item\label{subprob:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_horizontal_displacement}
    Let $t \geq 0$ be the amount of time in seconds since the
    cannonball was fired.  After $t$ seconds, the cannonball would
    have covered a horizontal distance of $v_xt$ metres.  Suppose that
    the cannonball was fired along the horizontal direction at a
    velocity of $v_x = 10$~metres per second.  If $X(t)$ represents
    the amount of horizontal distance that the cannonball covered
    after $t$ seconds, write an equation for $X(t)$.  Graph your
    function $X(t)$ from $t = 0$ to $t = 3$.  How long must you wait
    for the cannonball to have covered a horizontal distance of $25$
    metres?

  \item\label{subprob:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement}
    The cannonball is propelled only along the horizontal direction.
    As the cannonball travels along the horizontal direction, it is
    acted upon by the force of gravity, which is the constant of
    $g = 9.8$~metres per second squared.  Recall that when an object
    travels vertically under free fall, the vertical distance $Y(t)$
    in metres between the object and ground level after $t$ seconds
    can be approximated as the quadratic function
    $Y(t) = -\frac{1}{2} gt^2 + v_yt + h$, where air drag has been
    ignored.  Here, $v_y$ is the initial velocity with which the
    object is launched along the vertical direction and $h$ is the
    initial height in metres between the object and ground level.
    Since the cannonball is propelled only along the horizontal
    direction, the vertical velocity is $v_y = 0$.  Thus you can
    simplify $Y(t)$ as
    %%
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement}
    Y(t)
    =
    h - \frac{1}{2}gt^2.
    \end{equation}
    %%
    In other words, at any time $t \geq 0$ after the cannonball has
    been fired the function $X(t)$ describes the horizontal
    distance~(metres) from the cannonball to the tip of the cannon.
    Furthermore, the function $Y(t)$ describes the vertical
    distance~(metres) from the cannonball to ground level.  Suppose
    that the distance from the top of the cliff to ground level is
    $50$~metres.  Produce a graph of
    \Equation{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement}
    from time $t = 0$ to $t = 3.5$~seconds.  At $t = 2$ seconds after
    the cannonball has been fired, how far in metres is the cannonball
    to ground level?  How much time is required for the cannonball to
    be at a vertical distance of $25$~metres from ground level?

  \item\label{subprob:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_time_to_ground}
    Let the value of $h$ be as
    in \Part{subprob:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement}
    and let $Y(t)$ be defined by
    \Equation{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement}.
    Produce a table that has three columns and as many rows as
    necessary.  Going from left to right, the first column has the
    header $t$ and lists the time from $t = 0$ to $t = 3.5$ seconds
    with an increment of $0.1$ seconds.  The second column lists
    values of $X(t)$.  Finally, the third column lists values of
    $Y(t)$.  Graph values of $X(t)$ versus values of $Y(t)$, where
    values of $X(t)$ are on the horizontal axis and values of $Y(t)$
    are on the vertical axis.  Describe your graph.  After being
    fired, calculate the amount of time~(in seconds) required for the
    cannonball to land on the ground.  When the cannonball lands on
    the ground, determine the horizontal distance from the cannonball
    to the tip of the cannon.

  \item\label{subprob:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_intersection}
    On the same set of axes, graph the functions $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$
    from $t = 0$ to $t = \sqrt{50 / 4.9}$.  Use your graph to explain
    why, after the cannonball is fired, there is a positive value of
    $t$ such that $X(t) = Y(t)$.  Explain what the latter equality
    means.  Calculate a positive value of $t$ such that
    $X(t) = Y(t)$.

Suppose that the cannonball has covered a horizontal distance of
$25$~metres and you want to calculate the amount of time required to
cover the given distance.  You can write the problem as the equation
$X(t) = 25$ or equivalently as $10t = 25$.  Solving for $t$ shows that
you have $t = 25 / 10 = 2.5$.  That is, you must wait $2.5$ seconds in
order for the cannonball to travel a horizontal distance of $25$
metres.

You have $g = 9.8$~metres per second squared and $h = 50$~metres.
Then \Equation{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement}
can be simplified to
%%
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_vertical_distance_h_50}
\begin{aligned}
Y(t)
&=
50 - \frac{9.8}{2} t^2 \\[4pt]
&=
50 - 4.9 t^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%%
The latter expression is graphed in
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_vertical_displacement} from
$t = 0$ to $t = 3.5$.  When $t = 2$, you have
%%
\begin{align*}
Y(2)
&=
50 - 4.9 \cdot 2^2 \\[4pt]
&=
30.4.
\end{align*}
%%
In other words, at $t = 2$~seconds after being fired the cannonball
would be at a distance of $30.4$~metres to ground level.

Now suppose that the cannonball is at a distance of $25$~metres to
ground level.  To calculate the amount of time required, substitute
the expression $Y(t) = 25$ into
\Equation{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_vertical_distance_h_50} to obtain
the expression $50 - 4.9t^2 = 25$, which can also be written as
$4.9t^2 = 50 - 25$.  The last equation can be simplified to
$4.9t^2 = 25$.  Divide both sides by $4.9$ and then solve for $t$ to
obtain $t = \pm\sqrt{25 / 4.9}$.  Since $-\sqrt{25 / 4.9}$ is
negative, you may ignore this solution.  Conclude that at
approximately $t = \sqrt{25 / 4.9} \approx 2.26$~seconds after being
fired, the cannonball would be at a distance of $25$~metres to ground
level.

  seconds after being fired.  Some values in the right-most column

\Table{tab:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_path} shows values of $X(t)$ and
$Y(t)$ from $t = 0$ to $t = 3.5$ at an increment of $0.1$ seconds.
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_trajectory} shows a scatter
plot of values of $X(t)$ versus values of $Y(t)$.  The horizontal axis
represents the horizontal distance $X(t)$ from the cannonball to the
tip of the cannon, while the vertical axis represents the vertical
distance $Y(t)$ from the cannonball to ground level.  Values of
$t \geq 0$ represent time in seconds since the cannonball was fired.
Since the cannon is at a vertical distance of $50$~metres from ground
level, the point $\tuple{0}{50}$ represents where the tip of the
cannon is located.  The horizontal axis represents the ground level
and the vertical axis represents the cliff.

Let's determine the amount of time required for the fired cannonball
to reach ground level.  You have the expression $Y(t) = 0$, which asks
for all values of $t$ such that the equation is true.  Substitute the
latter expression into
\Equation{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_vertical_distance_h_50} to obtain
$50 - 4.9 t^2 = 0$ or equivalently the expression $4.9t^2 = 50$.
Divide both sides by $4.9$ and solving for $t$ shows that you have
$t = \pm\sqrt{50 / 4.9}$.  Since $-\sqrt{50 / 4.9}$ is negative, you
may ignore this solution.  Therefore at approximately
$t = \sqrt{50 / 4.9} \approx 3.19$~seconds after being fired, the
cannonball would land on the ground.

Finally, let's calculate the horizontal distance from the cannonball
to the tip of the cannon when the cannonball reaches ground level.
The function $X(t)$ models the horizontal distance from the cannonball
to the tip of the cannon at $t$ seconds after being fired.  Since the
cannonball requires $\sqrt{50 / 4.9}$ seconds to reach ground level,
then you have $X(\sqrt{50 / 4.9}) \approx 31.94$.  That is, when the
cannonball lands on the ground, the cannonball would be at a
horizontal distance of approximately $31.94$~metres from the tip of
the cannon.

\solutionpart{subprob:trigonometric:cannon_cliff_intersection}
\Figure{fig:trigonometric:cannonball_intersection} shows the graphs of
\Equations{eqn:trigonometric:horizontal_distance_to_cannon}{eqn:trigonometric:cannon_vertical_distance_h_50}
on the same set of axes.  The figure clearly shows that the graphs of
the functions $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ intersect each other at a positive
value of $t$.  The horizontal coordinate of the point of intersection
is bounded by the inequality $2 \leq t \leq 2.5$.  At the given
positive value of $t$, whatever it may be, you have the equality
$X(t) = Y(t)$.  The latter equality means that at $t$ seconds after
the cannonball is fired the horizontal distance $X(t)$ from the
cannonball to the tip of the cannon is the same as the vertical
distance $Y(t)$ from the cannonball to ground level.

Let's determine a positive value of $t$ such that $X(t) = Y(t)$.  Note
that the latter equality can be written as
$10t = 50 - 4.9t^2$ and moving everything to the left-hand side
results in the equation
\[
4.9t^2 + 10t - 50
=
0.
\]
The latter equation asks for the roots of the quadratic function
$f(t) = 4.9t^2 + 10t - 50$.  You have the discriminant
$\Delta = 10^2 - 4(4.9)(-50) = 1080$.  Using the quadratic formula,
the roots of $f(t)$ are
%%
\begin{align*}
t
&=
\frac{
  -10 \pm \sqrt{\Delta}
}{
  2(4.9)
} \\[4pt]
&=
\frac{
  -10 \pm \sqrt{1080}
}{
  9.8
}.
\end{align*}
%%
Note that
\[
t
=
\frac{
  -10 - \sqrt{1080}
}{
  9.8
}
\]
is a negative number, whereas
\[
t
=
\frac{
  -10 + \sqrt{1080}
}{
  9.8
}
\approx
2.332995.
\]
In other words, at approximately $t \approx 2.33$ seconds after the
cannonball is fired you have $X(t) = Y(t)$.
